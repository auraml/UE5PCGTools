Create a 3D racks system with a cluster consisting of 1 row and 4 columns. Each rack within the cluster has 3 rows and 1 column of trays. The trays in the rack are positioned with a pallet offset of x=15, y=0, z=11. The distance between rows is 271 units and between columns is 178 units. Fill the trays with pallets and position boxes randomly on top of each pallet.
