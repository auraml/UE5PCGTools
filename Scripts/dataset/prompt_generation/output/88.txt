Create a 3D racks cluster system with the following specifications: 
- The cluster consists of 1 row and 4 columns of racks.
- Each rack is designed with 4 rows and 2 columns of trays.
- The distance between rows is 463 units and between columns is 303 units.
- Within each tray, pallets are positioned with an offset of x=19, y=0, z=11. 
- Visualize the arrangement of boxes on the pallets within the trays to complete the system.
