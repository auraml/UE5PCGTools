Create a 3D racks cluster system with rows and columns specified as 4 and 3, respectively. The distance between rows is 462 units and between columns is 296 units. Each rack within the cluster comprises 2 rows and 3 columns. The trays inside each rack hold pallets positioned with an offset of 14 units on the x-axis, 0 units on the y-axis, and 11 units on the z-axis. Fill the pallets with boxes to complete the system.
