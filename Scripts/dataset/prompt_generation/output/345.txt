Create a 3D racks system with a cluster consisting of 1 row and 3 columns. In this layout, racks are organized in 5 rows and 3 columns with trays designed to hold pallets. The pallets should be positioned with an offset of x=18, y=0, z=11 within the trays. The distance between rows is 360 units, and between columns is 272 units. Get to work on visualizing this structured cluster setup!
