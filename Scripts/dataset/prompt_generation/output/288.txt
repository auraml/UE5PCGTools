Create a 3D racks cluster system with a grid layout of 3 rows and 3 columns. Each rack consists of 4 rows and 1 column. The pallets on trays have an offset of x: 15, y: 0, z: 11. The distance between rows is 267 units and between columns is 302 units. Position the boxes on the pallets within the trays to complete the cluster system.
