Create a 3D racks cluster system with 1 row and 5 columns. The racks within the cluster are organized in 4 rows and 3 columns. Each tray within a rack is designed to position pallets with an offset of x: 18, y: 0, z: 11. The distance between rows is 419 units and between columns is 152 units. Each pallet on the trays will hold multiple boxes. Build the system considering the specified dimensions and configurations for a well-structured layout.
