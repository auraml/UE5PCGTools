Create a 3D racks cluster system with 3 rows and 5 columns of racks. Each rack consists of 5 rows and 1 column of trays. The trays within each rack have pallets positioned with an offset of x: 13, y: 0, z: 11. The distance between rows is 261 units and between columns is 178 units. Start building the cluster now.
