Create a 3D racks cluster system with 5 rows and 4 columns of racks. Each rack within the cluster consists of 3 rows and 1 column of trays. The pallet within each tray has an offset of x: 14, y: 0, z: 11. The distance between rows is 275 units and between columns is 352 units. Build this layout to visualize a structured arrangement of trays and pallets in the cluster.
