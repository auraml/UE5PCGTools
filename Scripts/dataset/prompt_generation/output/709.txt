Create a 3D racks cluster system with a unique configuration. The cluster consists of 2 rows and 4 columns. Each rack within the cluster is structured in 3 rows and 4 columns. Trays in each rack are designed to hold pallets, with specific offsets of x: 13, y: 0, z: 11. The distance between rows is 94 units, and between columns is 113 units. Let's start building this intricate racks system!
