Create a 3D racks cluster system with the following specifications:
- Cluster with 4 rows and 3 columns.
- Racks arranged in 3 rows and 1 column within the cluster.
- Each tray within the rack has a pallet positioned with an offset of x=12, y=0, z=11.
- The distance between rows is 134 units and between columns is 418 units. 

Start by visualizing the cluster layout and then proceed to construct the racks, trays, pallets, and boxes accordingly.
