Create a 3D racks cluster system with 3 rows and 5 columns of racks. Each rack consists of 4 rows and 3 columns with trays for pallets, positioned with an offset of x: 20, y: 0, z: 11. The distance between rows is 94 units and between columns is 362 units. Start building the cluster system based on these specifications.
