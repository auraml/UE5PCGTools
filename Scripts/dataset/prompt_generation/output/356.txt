Create a 3D racks cluster system with multiple rows and columns of racks. Each rack consists of trays where pallets are positioned. Each tray has a specific offset for pallet placement. The cluster has 3 rows and 1 column, with racks arranged in 3 rows and 3 columns. The distance between rows is 353 units, and between columns is 466 units. Position the pallets with an offset of x: 11, y: 0, z: 11 on the trays within each rack.
