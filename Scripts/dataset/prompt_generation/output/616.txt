Create a 3D racks system with a single row cluster consisting of 3 columns. Within the cluster, arrange 3 racks in a column, each with 1 row. The trays in each rack hold pallets positioned with an offset of x: 14, y: 0, z: 11. The distance between rows is 88 units and between columns is 184 units. Be sure to accurately represent the pallets and boxes on the trays within this configuration.
