Create a 3D racks cluster system with 5 rows and 2 columns. Each rack consists of 5 rows and 3 columns. The trays within the racks have pallets positioned with an offset of x: 14, y: 0, z: 11. The distance between rows is 34 units, and between columns is 197 units. Each pallet on the tray will hold boxes arranged in a specific layout. Start constructing the layout in accordance with these specifications.
