Build a 3D racks cluster system with the following specifications:

- Cluster:
  - Rows: 2
  - Columns: 1
  - Distance between rows: 113
  - Distance between columns: 97

- Rack:
  - Rows: 4
  - Columns: 1
  
- Tray:
  - Pallet Offset:
    - X: 15
    - Y: 0
    - Z: 11

Construct the system based on these dimensions and configurations to visualize the arrangement of racks, trays, pallets, and boxes within the cluster.
