Create a 3D racks cluster system with 3 rows and 1 column of racks. Each rack consists of 4 rows and 4 columns of trays. The trays within a rack have pallets positioned with an offset of x: 11, y: 0, z: 11. Place boxes randomly on top of each pallet. Each row in the cluster is spaced 275 units apart, and each column is spaced 106 units apart. Let's build this unique cluster system in 3D!
