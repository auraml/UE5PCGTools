Create a 3D racks cluster system with a total of 15 racks organized in 3 rows and 5 columns. Each rack consists of 1 row and 1 column, with specific distances between rows and columns set to 239 and 98 units respectively. Place pallets on trays within the rack, ensuring an offset of 15 units along the x-axis, 0 units along the y-axis, and 11 units along the z-axis for each pallet.
