Construct a 3D racks cluster system with the following specifications: The cluster consists of 4 rows and 5 columns arranged with specific distances. Each rack within the cluster is designed with 5 rows and 3 columns. Trays within the racks include pallets positioned with an offset of x: 17, y: 0, z: 11 for optimal arrangement. Start by creating the cluster structure before moving on to individual racks with their trays, pallets, and boxes.
