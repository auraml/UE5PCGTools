Create a 3D racks cluster system with 5 rows and 4 columns of racks. Each rack consists of 2 rows and 4 columns of trays. Position the pallets on the trays with an offset of 20 in the x-direction, 0 in the y-direction, and 11 in the z-direction. The distance between rows is 185 units and between columns is 472 units.
