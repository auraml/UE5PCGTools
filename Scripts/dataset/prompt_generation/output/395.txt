Create a 3D racks system with a cluster consisting of 4 rows and 5 columns of racks. Each rack is composed of 5 rows and 4 columns of trays. The distance between rows is 228 units and between columns is 482 units. Each tray within the rack has a pallet positioned with an offset of x: 14, y: 0, z: 11. Each pallet holds randomly arranged boxes. Start building the system following these specifications.
