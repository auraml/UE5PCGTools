Create a 3D racks system with the following specifications: 

- Cluster consisting of 2 rows and 4 columns of racks, spaced 317 units apart in rows and 457 units apart in columns.
- Each rack has 5 rows and 2 columns of trays.
- Trays are designed to hold pallets with an offset of 19 units in the x-direction, 0 units in the y-direction, and 11 units in the z-direction. 

Use this information to generate a realistic 3D representation of the racks cluster system.
