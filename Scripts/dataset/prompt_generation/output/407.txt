Create a 3D racks cluster system with 3 rows and 4 columns of racks. Each rack consists of 5 rows and 3 columns of trays. The pallets inside trays have an offset of 14 in the x-axis, 0 in the y-axis, and 11 in the z-axis. The distance between rows is 328 units and 206 units between columns. Start by visualizing the cluster layout and then proceed to construct the racks and trays accordingly.
