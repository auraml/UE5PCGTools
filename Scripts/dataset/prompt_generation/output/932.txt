Create a 3D racks system with a cluster setup containing 2 rows and 2 columns of racks. Each rack consists of 1 row and 3 columns of trays. Pallets within trays have an offset of x: 15, y: 0, z: 11. The distance between rows is 284 units and between columns is 171 units. Let's visualize this cluster system with the specified dimensions and configurations.
