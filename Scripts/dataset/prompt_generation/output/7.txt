Create a 3D racks cluster system with 4 rows and 3 columns of racks. Each rack consists of 3 rows and 4 columns of trays. The pallets on trays have an offset of x: 11, y: 0, z: 11. Ensure the distance between rows is 16 units and between columns is 445 units. Start building this system in a virtual environment now.
