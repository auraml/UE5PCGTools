Create a 3D racks system with a cluster consisting of 2 rows and 2 columns. Each rack within the cluster is designed with 5 rows and 5 columns. The trays in the racks have pallets positioned with an offset of x: 11, y: 0, z: 11. The spacing between rows is 32 units and between columns is 306 units. Time to visualize this racks system!
