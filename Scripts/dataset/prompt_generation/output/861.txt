Build a 3D racks system with a cluster layout of 3 rows and 3 columns. Each rack within the cluster consists of 1 row and 5 columns. The trays on the racks can hold pallets positioned with an offset of x: 16, y: 0, z: 11. The distance between rows is 353 units and between columns is 324 units. Start constructing the racks cluster using these specifications.
