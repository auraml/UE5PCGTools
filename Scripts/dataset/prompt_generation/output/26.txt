Create a 3D racks cluster system with the following specifications: 

- Cluster layout: 5 rows and 5 columns of racks
- Inter-rack distance: 86 units horizontally and 258 units vertically
- Rack configuration: Each rack consists of 2 rows and 2 columns of trays
- Tray setup: Pallets on trays with an offset of x=14, y=0, z=11 units. 

Use these details to design and visualize the racks system accurately in 3D.
