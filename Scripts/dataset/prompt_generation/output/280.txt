Create a 3D racks cluster system with 2 rows and 5 columns of racks in the main cluster. Each rack within the cluster consists of 4 rows and 5 columns of trays for pallets. The pallets are positioned with an offset of x: 16, y: 0, z: 11 within the trays. The distance between rows is 235 units and between columns is 472 units.
