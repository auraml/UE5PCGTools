Create a 3D racks cluster system with the following specifications: Cluster comprising 5 rows and 4 columns of racks, each with a distance of 232 units between rows and 364 units between columns. Each rack consists of 3 rows and 4 columns of trays, with pallets positioned with an offset of 10 units on the x-axis, 0 units on the y-axis, and 11 units on the z-axis. Start building the cluster system based on these dimensions and configurations.
