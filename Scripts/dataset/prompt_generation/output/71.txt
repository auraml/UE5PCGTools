Construct a 3D racks cluster system with 4 rows and 2 columns. Within the cluster, there are racks organized in a layout of 5 rows and 3 columns. The trays within each rack are configured with pallets having offset positions of x: 19, y: 0, z: 11. The distance between rows is 118 units and between columns is 162 units. Start by visualizing this layout and arranging the racks accordingly.
