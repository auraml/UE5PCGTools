Create a 3D racks cluster system with multiple rows and columns of racks. The cluster consists of 3 rows and 5 columns, with a specific distance between rows and columns. Each rack is designed with 5 rows and 4 columns, incorporating trays where pallets are positioned. The pallets within the trays have an offset position of x: 12, y: 0, z: 11 for precise placement within the rack. Start by visualizing the cluster layout and the arrangement of racks within it based on the provided dimensions and configurations.
