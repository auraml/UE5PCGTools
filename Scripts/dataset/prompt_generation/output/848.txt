Create a 3D racks cluster system with 2 rows and 5 columns of racks. Each rack consists of 1 row and 1 column. The trays within the rack will have pallets positioned with an offset of x: 13, y: 0, z: 11. Ensure the distance between rows is 220 units and between columns is 451 units. Each pallet will hold boxes arranged in a random pattern.
