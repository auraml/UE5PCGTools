Create a 3D racks cluster system with 4 rows and 5 columns of racks. Each rack consists of 1 row and 2 columns of trays. Pallets are positioned on trays with an offset of x=17, y=0, z=11. Ensure the distance between rows is 412 units and between columns is 225 units. Let's build this clustered rack system in a virtual environment.
