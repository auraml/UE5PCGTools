Create a 3D racks cluster system with 5 rows and 4 columns of racks. Each rack consists of 2 rows and 5 columns of trays. The pallets on trays have an offset of x: 19, y: 0, z: 11. The distance between rows is 466 units and between columns is 463 units. Start arranging the boxes on the pallets within the trays to complete the cluster setup.
