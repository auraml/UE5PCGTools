Build a 3D racks cluster system with a cluster comprising 4 rows and 4 columns of racks. Each rack consists of 5 rows and 5 columns of trays. The distance between rows is 398 units, and between columns is 359 units. The pallet position on trays has an offset of x = 13, y = 0, z = 11 units. Let's create a visually organized and structured cluster system based on these specifications.
