Create a 3D racks system with a cluster containing 2 rows and 2 columns of racks. Each rack consists of 4 rows and 5 columns of trays. The pallets within the trays have an offset of x: 11, y: 0, z: 11. The distance between rows is 15 units and between columns is 66 units. Let's visualize this cluster arrangement in a 3D model.
