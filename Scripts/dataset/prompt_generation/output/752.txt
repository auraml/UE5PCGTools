Construct a 3D racks cluster system with 4 rows and 3 columns. Each rack within the cluster has 4 rows and 2 columns. The trays in each rack are designed to hold pallets with an offset of x: 19, y: 0, z: 11. The distance between rows is 162 units and between columns is 144 units. Start building the cluster system with these specifications.
