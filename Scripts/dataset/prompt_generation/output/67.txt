Create a 3D racks cluster system with 4 rows and 2 columns of racks. Each rack consists of 4 rows and 4 columns of trays where pallets are placed. The pallets have an offset of x=15, y=0, z=11 within the trays. The distance between rows is 486 units and between columns is 452 units. Start building the cluster system following these specifications.
