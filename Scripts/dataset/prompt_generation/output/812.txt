Create a 3D racks cluster system with 4 rows and 3 columns of racks. Each rack consists of 2 rows and 4 columns of trays. The distance between rows is 202 units, and between columns is 95 units. Position the pallets on the trays with an offset of x: 13, y: 0, z: 11. Each pallet will hold boxes in a specific arrangement.
