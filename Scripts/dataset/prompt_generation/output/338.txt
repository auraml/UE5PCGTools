Create a 3D racks cluster system with 5 rows and 3 columns of racks. Each rack has 5 rows and 3 columns of trays. The distance between rows is 240 units and between columns is 209 units. The pallets within the trays have an offset of x=18, y=0, and z=11 units. Start by visualizing the cluster layout before proceeding with the detailed construction of racks, trays, pallets, and boxes.
