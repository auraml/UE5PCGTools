Create a 3D racks system with a cluster configuration of 4 rows and 2 columns. Each rack within the cluster is organized with 4 rows and 4 columns. The distance between the rows is 451 units and between columns is 73 units. The trays in each rack have pallets with an offset position of x=11, y=0, z=11. Start by constructing the cluster structure followed by individual racks with trays and pallets.
