Create a 3D racks system with a cluster setup containing 4 rows and 3 columns of racks. Each rack consists of 4 rows and 5 columns of trays. The pallets within the trays have an offset of x: 12, y: 0, z: 11. The distance between rows is 88 units and between columns is 192 units. Start by arranging the racks in rows and columns to form the cluster structure.
