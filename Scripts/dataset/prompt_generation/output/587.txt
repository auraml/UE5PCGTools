Create a 3D racks cluster system with 4 rows and 3 columns of racks. Each rack consists of 3 rows and 3 columns of trays. The trays have pallets positioned with an offset of x=11, y=0, z=11. Ensure the distance between rows is 376 units and between columns is 49 units. Let's build this detailed racks system accurately.
