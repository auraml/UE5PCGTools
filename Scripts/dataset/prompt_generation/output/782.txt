Create a 3D racks cluster system with 2 rows and 4 columns of racks. Each rack consists of 4 rows and 3 columns of trays. The pallet on each tray has an offset of x: 15, y: 0, z: 11. The distance between rows is 124 units and between columns is 290 units. Let's build this unique racks configuration in 3D.
