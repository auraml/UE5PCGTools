Create a 3D racks cluster system with 2 rows and 2 columns of clusters. Each cluster consists of 4 rows and 3 columns of racks. The distance between rows is 348 units and between columns is 247 units. Within each rack, trays are positioned with a pallet offset of x=17, y=0, z=11 units for storing pallets holding boxes.
