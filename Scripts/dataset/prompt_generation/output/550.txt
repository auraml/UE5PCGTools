Create a 3D racks cluster system with 2 rows and 3 columns of racks. Each rack consists of 2 rows and 1 column of trays. The trays within the rack are designed to hold pallets, with an offset of x=11, y=0, z=11. The distance between rows is 277 units and between columns is 274 units. Start building the cluster system based on these specifications.
