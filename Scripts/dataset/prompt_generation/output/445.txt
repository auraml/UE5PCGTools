Create a 3D racks cluster system with 5 rows and 3 columns. The racks are positioned with a distance of 12 units between rows and 140 units between columns. Each rack contains 1 row and 1 column of trays. The pallets on the trays have an offset position of x=14, y=0, z=11. Build the system accordingly.
