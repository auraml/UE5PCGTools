Create a 3D racks cluster system with the following specifications: 
- Cluster consisting of 1 row and 1 column.
- The distance between rows is 451 units and between columns is 210 units.
- Inside the cluster, there is a rack with 1 row and 5 columns.
- A tray in the rack holds pallets with an offset of x: 13, y: 0, z: 11. 

Implement this configuration to visualize the racks system accurately.
