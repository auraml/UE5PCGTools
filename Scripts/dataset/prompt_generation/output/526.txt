Create a 3D racks cluster system with 2 rows and 3 columns of racks. Each rack consists of 2 rows and 1 column of trays. The pallets within the trays have an offset positioning of x: 12, y: 0, z: 11. The distance between rows is 46 units and between columns is 197 units. Start building the cluster system according to these specifications.
