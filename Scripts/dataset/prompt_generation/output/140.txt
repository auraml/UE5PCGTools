Create a 3D racks cluster system with 3 rows and 4 columns of racks. Each rack consists of 2 rows and 1 column of trays. The pallet within each tray is positioned with an offset of x: 18, y: 0, z: 11. The distance between rows is 175 units and between columns is 241 units. Start building the cluster system based on these specifications.
