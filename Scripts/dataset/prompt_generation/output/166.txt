Create a 3D racks cluster system with 3 rows and 1 column of racks. Each rack consists of 4 rows and 4 columns of trays. The pallet on each tray is positioned with an offset of x: 16, y: 0, z: 11. The distance between rows is 77 units, and between columns is 258 units. Build the system with these specifications.
