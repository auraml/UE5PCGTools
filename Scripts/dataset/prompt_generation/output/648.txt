Create a 3D racks cluster system with 4 rows and 1 column of racks. Each rack consists of 5 rows and 3 columns of trays. The pallet on each tray is positioned with an offset of x: 14, y: 0, z: 11. Use a distance of 408 between rows and 367 between columns to arrange the racks in the cluster. Each pallet will hold boxes in a structured layout.
