Create a 3D racks cluster system with the following specifications:

- Cluster: Rows - 3, Columns - 1, Row Distance - 272, Column Distance - 436.
- Rack: Rows - 4, Columns - 1.
- Tray: Positioned with a pallet offset at x: 15, y: 0, z: 11.

This layout forms a structured arrangement of racks within the cluster system, facilitating efficient storage and organization of pallets and boxes.
