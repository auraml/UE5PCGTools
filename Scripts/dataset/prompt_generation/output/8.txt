Create a 3D racks cluster system with the following specifications: 

- Total cluster size: 5 rows by 5 columns
- Distance between rows: 451 units, between columns: 344 units
- Each rack within the cluster contains:
  - Layout: 5 rows by 4 columns
  - Tray pallet offset: X=20, Y=0, Z=11

Start by visualizing the cluster layout with racks arranged in rows and columns. Each rack should have trays with pallets positioned according to the specified offsets. Happy designing!
