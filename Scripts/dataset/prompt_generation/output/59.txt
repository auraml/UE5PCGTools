Create a 3D racks cluster system with the following specifications: 

- Cluster consisting of 1 row and 3 columns of racks.
- Racks configured with 4 rows and 5 columns of trays.
- Each tray contains pallets with an offset of x: 20, y: 0, z: 11.
- The distance between rows is 461 and between columns is 198. 

Model the racks setup based on these dimensions and attributes to visualize the cluster system accurately in 3D.
