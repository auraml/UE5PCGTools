Create a 3D racks cluster system with a single row and two columns. The cluster consists of five rows of racks, each with one column. Within each rack, there are trays where pallets are placed. The pallets are positioned with an offset of 14 units on the x-axis, 0 units on the y-axis, and 11 units on the z-axis. The distance between rows is 140 units and between columns is 421 units.
