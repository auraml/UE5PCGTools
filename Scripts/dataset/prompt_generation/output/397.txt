Create a 3D racks cluster system with 3 rows and 5 columns of racks. Each rack consists of 5 rows and 3 columns of trays. The distance between rows is 235 units and between columns is 479 units. Each pallet on a tray has an offset of 12 units on the x-axis, 0 units on the y-axis, and 11 units on the z-axis. Remember to position boxes randomly on top of each pallet.
