Create a 3D racks cluster system with 4 rows and 2 columns. Each rack in the cluster consists of 4 rows and 3 columns. The distance between rows is 443 units and between columns is 131 units. Configure the pallet trays within each rack with an offset of x=19, y=0, z=11 for optimal placement of pallets holding boxes. Start building the cluster system using these specifications.
