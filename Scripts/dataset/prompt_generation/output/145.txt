Create a 3D racks system with a cluster configuration consisting of 3 rows and 5 columns. The racks within the cluster are organized in 3 rows and 2 columns. Each tray within a rack is designed to hold pallets with an offset of x: 12, y: 0, z: 11. The distance between rows is 21 units and between columns is 321 units. Start building the cluster system based on these specifications.
