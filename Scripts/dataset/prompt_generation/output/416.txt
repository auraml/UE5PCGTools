Create a 3D racks system with a cluster setup containing 4 rows and 3 columns. Each rack in the cluster has 4 rows and 1 column. The trays in the rack are positioned with a pallet offset of x: 19, y: 0, z: 11. The distance between rows is 444 units and between columns is 254 units. Fill the trays with pallets holding boxes to visualize the complete system.
