Create a 3D racks cluster system with 4 rows and 3 columns of racks. Each rack is designed with 5 rows and 1 column of trays. The pallets within the trays have an offset of x: 12, y: 0, z: 11. The spacing between rows is 224 units and between columns is 337 units. Let's bring this cluster system to life in 3D!
