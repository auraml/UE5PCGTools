Create a 3D racks cluster system with 2 rows and 4 columns of racks. Each rack consists of 4 rows and 2 columns of trays. The distance between rows is 283 units and between columns is 193 units. Each tray within a rack has pallets positioned with an offset of 14 units in the x-direction, 0 units in the y-direction, and 11 units in the z-direction. Start building the cluster system based on these specifications.
