Create a 3D racks cluster system with 2 rows and 2 columns of racks. Each rack consists of 5 rows and 2 columns of trays. The trays contain pallets positioned with an offset of x: 11, y: 0, z: 11. Ensure the distance between rows is 406 and between columns is 415 to accurately represent the cluster layout.
