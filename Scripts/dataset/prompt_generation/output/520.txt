Build a 3D racks cluster system consisting of 5 rows and 2 columns of racks. Each rack contains 1 row and 2 columns of trays. The pallet on each tray is positioned with an offset of x: 14, y: 0, z: 11. The distance between rows is 319 units and between columns is 190 units. Start constructing the cluster system based on these specifications.
