Create a 3D racks system with a cluster setup consisting of 5 rows and 5 columns. The racks are organized in a grid pattern with 3 rows and 4 columns. Each tray within the rack has a pallet offset defined by x: 16, y: 0, z: 11. The distance between rows is 225 units and between columns is 321 units. Start building the cluster system based on this configuration.
