Create a 3D racks cluster system with 4 rows and 1 column of racks. Each rack consists of 3 rows and 5 columns of trays. The distance between rows is 147 units and between columns is 493 units. Place pallets on trays with an offset of x=13, y=0, z=11 for optimal positioning. Ready to build a visually appealing and organized racks system based on these specifications!
