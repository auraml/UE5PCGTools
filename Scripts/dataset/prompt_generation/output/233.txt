Create a 3D racks cluster system with 2 rows and 5 columns of racks. The racks are built with 4 rows and 1 column of trays, each tray having pallets positioned with an offset of x: 11, y: 0, z: 11. The distance between rows is 338 units and between columns is 194 units. Each pallet on the tray will hold boxes in a specific arrangement. Start building this unique racks cluster system now.
