Create a 3D racks cluster system with 4 rows and 2 columns of racks. Each rack consists of 3 rows and 1 column, with trays for pallets positioned with an offset of x: 12, y: 0, z: 11. The distance between rows is 335 units and between columns is 76 units. Build a dynamic 3D model following these specifications.
