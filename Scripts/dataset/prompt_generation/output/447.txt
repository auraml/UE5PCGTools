Create a 3D racks cluster system with 5 rows and 4 columns, where racks are arranged with a spacing of 241 units horizontally and 284 units vertically. Each rack consists of 2 rows and 2 columns of trays, with pallets positioned with an offset of x: 15, y: 0, z: 11. Start by generating the cluster layout with these specifications.
