Create a 3D racks cluster system with 4 rows and 2 columns of racks. Each rack consists of 5 rows and 4 columns of trays. The pallets on the trays have an offset of x: 20, y: 0, z: 11. The distance between rows is 374 units and between columns is 228 units. Begin by arranging the racks in rows and columns within the cluster, then construct the trays within each rack based on the specified dimensions. Finally, position the pallets on the trays with the given offset to set up the foundation for box arrangements.
