Create a 3D racks cluster system with a single row and two columns. The racks within the cluster are organized in a 5x2 grid pattern. Each tray in the rack is designed to hold pallets with an offset of 17 units along the x-axis, 0 units along the y-axis, and 11 units along the z-axis. Position the racks such that there is a distance of 29 units between the rows and 139 units between the columns.
