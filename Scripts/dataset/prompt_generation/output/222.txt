Create a 3D racks cluster system with 5 rows and 2 columns of racks. Each rack is structured with 4 rows and 4 columns. The trays within the rack have pallets positioned with an offset of x=20, y=0, and z=11. The distance between rows is 98 units and between columns is 303 units. Each pallet holds boxes that are randomly arranged. Build the cluster carefully to visualize the arrangement effectively.
