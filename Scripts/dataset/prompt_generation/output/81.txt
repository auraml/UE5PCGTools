Create a 3D racks cluster system with 2 rows and 3 columns of racks. Each rack consists of 2 rows and 2 columns of trays. The distance between rows is 406 units and between columns is 252 units. Each pallet within a tray has an offset of x: 10, y: 0, z: 11 for positioning. Start building the cluster system based on this configuration.
