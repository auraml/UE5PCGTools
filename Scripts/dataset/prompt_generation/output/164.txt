Create a 3D racks cluster system with 2 rows and 3 columns. Each rack within the cluster consists of 3 rows and 5 columns. The trays in the racks have a pallet offset of x: 12, y: 0, z: 11. The distance between rows is 288 units and between columns is 317 units. Start building the cluster system based on these specifications.
