Create a 3D racks cluster system with 1 row and 4 columns. Each rack in the cluster consists of 5 rows and 3 columns. The distance between rows is 102 units and between columns is 426 units. Within each tray, position pallets with an offset of x: 13, y: 0, z: 11 for accurate placement. Let's build this structured and organized racks system.
