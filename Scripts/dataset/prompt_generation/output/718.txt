Create a 3D racks cluster system with 5 rows and 2 columns of racks. Each rack consists of 4 rows and 5 columns of trays, where pallets are positioned with an offset of x: 19, y: 0, z: 11. The distance between rows is 374 units and between columns is 164 units. Place boxes randomly on top of each pallet in the system.
