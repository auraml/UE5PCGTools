Create a 3D racks cluster system with the following specifications:

- Cluster:
  - Rows: 4
  - Columns: 1
  - Row distance: 252 units
  - Column distance: 218 units

- Rack:
  - Rows: 5
  - Columns: 1
  
- Tray:
  - Pallet offset:
    - X: 19 units
    - Y: 0 units
    - Z: 11 units

Use these details to construct the racks system with multiple racks arranged in rows and columns, ensuring proper spacing and alignment between trays and pallets.
