Create a 3D racks cluster system with 5 rows and 3 columns. Design the racks with 5 rows and 1 column each. The distance between rows is 124 units and between columns is 226 units. Each tray within the rack should have pallets positioned with an offset of x: 14, y: 0, z: 11. Place boxes randomly on each pallet to complete the setup.
