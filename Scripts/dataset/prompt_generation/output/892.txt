Please create a 3D racks cluster system with 4 rows and 5 columns of racks in a grid layout. Each rack consists of 1 row and 3 columns, set apart by a distance of 329 units vertically and 144 units horizontally. The trays within each rack have pallets positioned with an offset of 10 units along the x-axis, 0 units along the y-axis, and 11 units along the z-axis. Each pallet holds randomly arranged boxes.
