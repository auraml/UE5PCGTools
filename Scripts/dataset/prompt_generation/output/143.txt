Create a 3D racks cluster system with multiple racks arranged in rows and columns. The cluster consists of 4 rows and 3 columns separated by 253 units along rows and 103 units along columns. Each rack is composed of 2 rows and 5 columns. The trays within the rack have pallets positioned with an offset of 14 units along the x-axis, 0 units along the y-axis, and 11 units along the z-axis. Ensure that pallets are placed accurately within the trays to hold boxes securely.
