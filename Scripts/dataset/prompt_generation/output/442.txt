Create a 3D racks cluster system with 5 rows and 1 column. Each rack within the cluster is structured with 3 rows and 1 column. The trays in the rack will be positioned with an offset of x: 15, y: 0, z: 11 for the pallets. Each row in the cluster will have a distance of 280 units, and each column will have a distance of 284 units. Start by arranging the racks in rows and columns according to the provided specifications.
