Create a 3D racks cluster system with 2 rows and 4 columns of racks. Each rack consists of 4 rows and 2 columns of trays. The distance between rows is 294 units and between columns is 20 units. The pallets on trays have an offset of 18 units along the x-axis, 0 units along the y-axis, and 11 units along the z-axis. Position the boxes randomly on the pallets within the system.
