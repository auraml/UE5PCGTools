Create a 3D racks cluster system with 2 rows and 4 columns of racks. Each rack contains 2 rows and 1 column of trays. The pallets within the trays have an offset of x: 20, y: 0, z: 11. The distance between rows is 403 units, and between columns is 336 units. Build this system ensuring accurate positioning and alignment of the components.
