Create a 3D racks cluster system with 4 rows and 5 columns of racks. Each rack consists of 5 rows and 3 columns of trays. The pallets within the trays have an offset of x=16, y=0, z=11. The distance between rows is 106 units and between columns is 361 units. The racks are arranged systematically to optimize space utilization and organization.
