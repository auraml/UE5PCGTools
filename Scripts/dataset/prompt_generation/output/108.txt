Create a 3D racks cluster system with multiple rows and columns. Each rack within the cluster consists of trays for pallets with specific offset values for positioning. The cluster has 3 rows and 5 columns of racks, with a distance of 79 units between rows and 220 units between columns. The rack is structured in 3 rows and 5 columns. The tray within the rack positions pallets with an offset of x: 17, y: 0, z: 11.
