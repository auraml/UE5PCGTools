Create a 3D racks cluster system with the following configuration: 

- Cluster with 2 rows and 2 columns, with row distance of 277 units and column distance of 22 units.
- Each rack within the cluster has 1 row and 4 columns.
- The tray within the rack has a pallet positioned with an offset of 12 units along the x-axis, 0 units along the y-axis, and 11 units along the z-axis. 

Use these specifications to layout the racks system in a virtual environment.
