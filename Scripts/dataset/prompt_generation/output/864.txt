Create a 3D racks cluster system with 2 rows and 5 columns of racks. Each rack consists of 1 row and 1 column, arranged with specific distances of 348 units horizontally and 19 units vertically. Inside the rack, position a tray with a pallet offset at x: 12, y: 0, z: 11. Fill the pallet with boxes to complete the cluster visualization.
