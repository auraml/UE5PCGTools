Create a 3D racks cluster system with 3 rows and 5 columns of racks. Each rack consists of 5 rows and 3 columns of trays. The distance between rows is 270 units, and between columns is 158 units. Position the pallets on the trays with an offset of x: 17, y: 0, z: 11 units. Fill the pallets with boxes to complete the cluster setup.
