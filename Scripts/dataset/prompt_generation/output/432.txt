Create a 3D racks cluster system with the following specifications:

- The cluster consists of 2 rows and 1 column.
- The distance between rows is 169 units and between columns is 38 units.
- Each rack in the cluster is organized into 3 rows and 4 columns.
- The trays within the racks have pallets positioned with an offset of x = 17, y = 0, z = 11 units.

Build the racks system according to these dimensions and layout to visualize the arrangement of pallets within the trays.
