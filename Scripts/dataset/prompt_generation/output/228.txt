Create a 3D racks system with a cluster consisting of 4 rows and 2 columns of racks. Each rack has 1 row and 5 columns of trays for pallets, positioned with an offset of x: 15, y: 0, z: 11 within the rack. The distance between rows is 344 units and between columns is 331 units. Place boxes randomly on the pallets to complete the setup.
