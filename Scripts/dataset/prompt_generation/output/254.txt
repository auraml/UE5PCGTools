Create a 3D racks cluster system with 3 rows and 2 columns. Each rack within the cluster has 3 rows and 1 column. The trays in the rack have pallets positioned with an offset of x=20, y=0, z=11. The distance between rows is 324 units and between columns is 48 units. This configuration forms a structured and organized storage solution for boxes within the racks.
