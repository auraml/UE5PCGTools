Create a 3D racks cluster system with 2 rows and 2 columns of racks. Each rack consists of 4 rows and 3 columns. The distance between rows is 475 units, and between columns is 120 units. Each tray within a rack has pallets positioned with an offset of x: 16, y: 0, z: 11. Let's visualize this cluster system with accurate placement and alignment of trays, pallets, and boxes.
