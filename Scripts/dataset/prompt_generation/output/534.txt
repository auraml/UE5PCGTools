Build a 3D racks system with a cluster comprising 5 rows and 1 column of racks. Each rack has 1 row and 3 columns of trays for pallets. The pallets within the trays have an offset of x: 20, y: 0, z: 11. The distance between rows is 49 units and between columns is 133 units. Start constructing the system based on this layout.
