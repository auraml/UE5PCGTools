Create a 3D racks cluster system with 4 rows and 4 columns of racks. Each rack consists of 3 rows and 5 columns of trays. The pallets within the trays are positioned with an offset of x: 11, y: 0, z: 11. The distance between rows is 169 units and between columns is 165 units. Build the cluster system accordingly.
