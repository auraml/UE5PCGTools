Create a 3D racks cluster system with 3 rows and 5 columns of racks. Each rack consists of 4 rows and 1 column, where trays hold pallets positioned with an offset of x: 17, y: 0, z: 11. The distance between rows is 467 units and between columns is 171 units. Place boxes randomly on top of each pallet in the trays.
