Create a 3D racks system with a cluster configuration consisting of 5 rows and 3 columns. Each rack within the cluster is organized with 3 rows and 1 column. The pallet trays within the rack are positioned with an offset of x: 15, y: 0, z: 11. Let's model this cluster with attention to the specified row and column distances.
