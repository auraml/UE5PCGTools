Create a 3D racks cluster system with the following specifications:
- Cluster configuration: 3 rows and 3 columns
- Distance between rows: 178 units, and between columns: 450 units
- Rack setup: 1 row with 3 columns
- Tray with pallet offset: x=14, y=0, z=11

Start by arranging the racks in rows and columns based on the provided dimensions. Then, construct each rack with trays supporting pallets positioned at the specified offset coordinates.
