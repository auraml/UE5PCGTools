Create a 3D racks cluster system with the following specifications: 

- Cluster: 3 rows and 3 columns, with distances between rows of 270 units and between columns of 31 units.
- Each rack within the cluster has 3 rows and 2 columns.
- Trays within the rack have pallets positioned with an offset of x=11, y=0, z=11 units. 

Use this information to visually construct the racks system with accurate dimensions and positioning for an efficient cluster setup.
