Create a 3D racks cluster system with 4 rows and 1 column of racks. Each rack consists of 5 rows and 4 columns of trays. The trays within each rack are designed to hold pallets with an offset of x=11, y=0, z=11. The distance between rows is 213 units, and between columns is 257 units. Each pallet within the trays will carry boxes.
