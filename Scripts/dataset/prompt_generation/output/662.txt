Create a 3D racks cluster system with a total of 4 rows and 3 columns. The racks are arranged with a distance of 272 units between rows and 439 units between columns. Each rack consists of 4 rows and 2 columns of trays, with pallets positioned with an offset of x: 19, y: 0, z: 11. Start by visualizing the cluster layout and then proceed to construct the individual racks with trays, pallets, and boxes accordingly.
