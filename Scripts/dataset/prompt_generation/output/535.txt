Create a 3D racks cluster system with the following specifications: 
- Cluster configuration: 2 rows and 2 columns
- Row distance: 105 units, Column distance: 471 units
- Each rack within the cluster consists of 3 rows and 5 columns
- Each tray within the rack is designed to position pallets with an offset of x: 13, y: 0, z: 11. 
Start building the 3D model adhering to these dimensions and configurations.
