Create a 3D racks cluster system with a cluster consisting of 5 rows and 1 column. Each rack within the cluster has 5 rows and 2 columns. The trays in the racks have pallets positioned with an offset of x: 13, y: 0, z: 11. Ensure the distance between rows is 24 and between columns is 440. Let's build this unique arrangement of racks and trays to visualize the efficient storage system.
