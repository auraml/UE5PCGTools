Create a 3D racks cluster system with 5 rows and 2 columns of racks. Each rack consists of 1 row and 3 columns of trays. The distance between rows is 303 units and between columns is 47 units. Position each pallet on the tray with an offset of 11 units along the x-axis and z-axis. Start building the cluster now.
