Create a 3D racks cluster system with 4 rows and 5 columns. Each rack consists of 2 rows and 2 columns. The pallets within each rack have an offset of x: 11, y: 0, z: 11 to position them correctly on the trays. The distance between rows is 368 units and between columns is 348 units. Start by arranging the racks in rows and columns according to the given specifications.
