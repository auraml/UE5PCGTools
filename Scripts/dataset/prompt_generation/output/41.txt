Create a 3D racks system with a cluster consisting of 5 rows and 4 columns of racks. Each rack has 2 rows and 5 columns of trays. The trays hold pallets with an offset of x: 19, y: 0, z: 11. The distance between rows is 125 units and between columns is 235 units. Start by arranging the racks in rows and columns within the cluster, ensuring proper alignment and spacing between them. Then, construct the trays within each rack and position the pallets on them accordingly to set the foundation for the boxes to be placed in the system.
