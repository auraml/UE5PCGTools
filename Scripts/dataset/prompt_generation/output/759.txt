Create a 3D racks cluster system with 5 rows and 1 column. Each rack within this cluster consists of 5 rows and 3 columns, with trays that have pallets positioned with an offset of x: 19, y: 0, z: 11. The distance between rows is 209 units and between columns is 121 units. Each pallet on the trays will hold boxes. Start by arranging the racks in rows and columns to build the cluster system.
