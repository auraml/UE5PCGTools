Create a 3D racks system with a cluster consisting of 2 rows and 3 columns. Each rack in the cluster has 4 columns and 1 row, with trays configured for pallets. Position the pallets with an offset of 12 along the x-axis, 0 along the y-axis, and 11 along the z-axis within the trays. Ensure a distance of 360 between rows and 86 between columns in the cluster layout.
