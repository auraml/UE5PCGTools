Create a 3D racks cluster system with 3 rows and 5 columns of clusters. Each rack within the cluster consists of 3 rows and 3 columns. The trays in the rack have pallets positioned with an offset of x: 13, y: 0, z: 11. The spacing between rows is 211 units and between columns is 428 units. Build the system accordingly.
