Create a 3D racks system with a cluster consisting of 4 rows and 5 columns of racks. Each rack is structured with 4 rows and 5 columns of trays. The pallets within the trays have an offset of x: 17, y: 0, z: 11. The distance between rows is 241 units and between columns is 201 units. Each rack is meticulously designed to accommodate the specified number of trays for optimal organization.
