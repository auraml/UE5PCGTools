Create a 3D racks cluster system with 2 rows and 4 columns of racks. Each rack consists of 4 rows and 3 columns of trays. The trays within each rack will hold pallets with an offset of x: 19, y: 0, z: 11. Ensure a distance of 457 units between rows and 485 units between columns for a well-organized cluster layout.
