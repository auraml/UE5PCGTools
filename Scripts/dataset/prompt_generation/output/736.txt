Create a 3D racks cluster system with a single row and four columns. Within the cluster, there are 4 rows and 4 columns of racks arranged. Each rack contains trays with pallets positioned with an offset of x: 19, y: 0, z: 11. The spacing between rows is 342 units and between columns is 327 units. Each pallet holds boxes that are arranged in a random order. Start building the system based on these specifications.
