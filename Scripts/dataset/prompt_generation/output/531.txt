Create a 3D racks cluster system with 4 rows and 1 column. The racks within the cluster are organized in a grid pattern with 4 rows and 2 columns. Each tray within the racks is positioned with an offset of x: 12, y: 0, z: 11 for pallet placement. Build the cluster system with rows spaced 127 units apart and columns spaced 83 units apart. Fill the trays with pallets to hold boxes in the 3D model.
