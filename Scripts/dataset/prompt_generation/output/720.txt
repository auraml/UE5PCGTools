Create a 3D racks cluster system with 4 rows and 5 columns. The racks are arranged in a grid with a distance of 320 units between rows and 70 units between columns. Each rack consists of 2 rows and 4 columns. Inside each rack, trays are positioned with pallets starting at an offset of x: 18, y: 0, z: 11. Let's build this cluster system in 3D!
