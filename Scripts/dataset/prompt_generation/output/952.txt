Create a 3D racks cluster system with 5 rows of racks in a single column. Each rack consists of 2 rows and 1 column. The distance between rows is 181 units and between columns is 250 units. The trays within the racks have pallets positioned with an offset of 16 units along the x-axis, 0 units along the y-axis, and 11 units along the z-axis. Each pallet holds boxes that are randomly arranged on top.
