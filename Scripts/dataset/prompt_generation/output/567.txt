Construct a clustered system consisting of 4 rows and 3 columns of racks. Each rack, made up of 5 rows and 4 columns of trays, will have pallets positioned with an offset of x: 11, y: 0, z: 11. The distance between rows is 55 and between columns is 315. Start building the 3D model based on this arrangement.
