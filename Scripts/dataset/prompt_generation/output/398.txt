Create a 3D racks cluster system with 5 rows and 2 columns. The racks are organized in a grid with a distance of 179 units between rows and 111 units between columns. Each rack consists of 3 rows and 5 columns of trays. The trays have pallets positioned with an offset of 16 units in the x-axis, 0 units in the y-axis, and 11 units in the z-axis. Each pallet holds boxes in this setup.
