Create a 3D racks cluster system with the following specifications: 

- The cluster consists of 5 rows and 3 columns, organized with specific distances between rows (283) and columns (189).
- Inside the cluster, there are 4 rows and 3 columns of racks, each rack containing trays for pallets.
- Place the pallets on trays with offsets in the x-axis (13), y-axis (0), and z-axis (11).

Visualize and design the cluster system with these details to accurately represent the arrangement of racks, trays, pallets, and boxes within the cluster.
