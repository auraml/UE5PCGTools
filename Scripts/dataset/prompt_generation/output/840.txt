Create a 3D racks cluster system with 2 rows and 5 columns of racks. Each rack consists of 4 rows and 4 columns of trays with pallets positioned at an offset of x: 19, y: 0, z: 11. The distance between rows is 116 units and between columns is 266 units. Start building the cluster system based on these specifications.
