Create a 3D racks system with a single row and five columns in the cluster. The rack setup consists of 4 rows and 3 columns. Each tray within the rack has a pallet positioned with an offset of x: 17, y: 0, z: 11. The distance between rows is 344 units and between columns is 198 units. Fill the trays with boxes to complete the visualization.
