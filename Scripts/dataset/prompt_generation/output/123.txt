Create a 3D racks cluster system with 2 rows and 4 columns of racks. Each rack consists of 1 row and 5 columns of trays. The trays include pallets with an offset of x: 13, y: 0, z: 11. The distance between rows is 449 units and between columns is 382 units. Start building the cluster system following these specifications.
