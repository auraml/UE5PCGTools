Create a 3D racks cluster system with a unique configuration. The cluster consists of 3 rows and 1 column of racks, spaced apart by 238 units horizontally and 371 units vertically. Each rack contains 1 row and 5 columns of trays. The pallets on the trays have an offset placement of 10 units along the x-axis, 0 units along the y-axis, and 11 units along the z-axis. Start building the cluster system with these specifications.
