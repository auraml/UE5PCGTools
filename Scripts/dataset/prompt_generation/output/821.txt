Create a 3D racks cluster system with 3 rows and 4 columns of racks. Each rack consists of 3 rows and 5 columns of trays for pallet placement. The distance between rows is 32 units and between columns is 127 units. Position the pallets on trays with an offset of x: 12, y: 0, z: 11 units. Each pallet will hold boxes arranged in a unique pattern.
