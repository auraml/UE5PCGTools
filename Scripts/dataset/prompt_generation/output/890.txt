Create a 3D racks system with a cluster consisting of 3 rows and 4 columns. Each rack within the cluster is designed with 5 rows and 3 columns. The trays in the racks have pallets positioned with an offset of x=10, y=0, z=11. The distance between rows is 422 units and between columns is 356 units. Fill the pallets with boxes to complete the cluster system.
