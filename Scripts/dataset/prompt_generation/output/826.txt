Create a 3D racks cluster system with 4 rows and 1 column of racks. Each rack consists of 3 rows and 3 columns of trays. The distance between rows is 192 units and between columns is 285 units. The pallets on the trays have an offset of x=15, y=0, z=11 units. Position the boxes randomly on the pallets to complete the cluster setup.
