Create a 3D racks cluster system with a single row and two columns. The racks are organized with each consisting of 2 rows and 2 columns. The pallet trays in the racks have an offset position of x: 17, y: 0, z: 11 to place the pallets. The distance between rows and columns is 353 units. Start by arranging the racks in a cluster format and then construct the trays within each rack according to the specified dimensions and offsets.
