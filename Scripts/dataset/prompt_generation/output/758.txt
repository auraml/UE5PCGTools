Create a 3D racks cluster system with 5 rows and 4 columns of racks. Each rack consists of 3 rows and 4 columns of trays. The trays have pallets positioned with an offset of x: 11, y: 0, z: 11. The distance between rows is 249 and between columns is 182. Start by visualizing the cluster layout and then populate the trays with pallets and boxes accordingly.
