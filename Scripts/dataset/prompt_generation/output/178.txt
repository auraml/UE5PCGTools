Build a 3D racks cluster system with 4 rows and 3 columns. The racks are organized with 3 rows and 2 columns, featuring trays where pallets are positioned with an offset of x: 16, y: 0, z: 11. Ensure a distance of 201 between rows and 92 between columns. Each pallet within the trays holds boxes in a unique arrangement.
