Create a 3D racks system with a cluster consisting of 4 rows and 2 columns. The racks are arranged at a distance of 162 units between rows and 441 units between columns. Each rack within the cluster is configured with 1 row and 3 columns. The trays in the rack have pallets positioned with an offset of 18 units along the x-axis, 0 units along the y-axis, and 11 units along the z-axis. Fill the pallets with boxes to complete the cluster setup.
