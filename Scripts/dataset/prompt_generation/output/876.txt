Create a 3D racks system with a single cluster consisting of 1 row and 1 column. The racks within the cluster are organized in 2 rows and 3 columns, with trays positioned to hold pallets at an offset of x: 19, y: 0, z: 11. The distance between rows is 236 units, and between columns is 237 units. Each pallet on the trays will accommodate boxes in a unique arrangement.
