Create a 3D racks system with a cluster containing 1 row and 3 columns. The racks are organized in 2 rows and 3 columns within the cluster. Each tray within the rack has a pallet positioned with an offset of x: 10, y: 0, z: 11 for optimal arrangement of boxes. The distance between rows is 293 units and between columns is 402 units.
