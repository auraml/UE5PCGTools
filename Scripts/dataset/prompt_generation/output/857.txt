Create a 3D racks system with a cluster consisting of 5 rows and 5 columns. The racks within the cluster are arranged in 5 rows and 4 columns. Each tray in the rack is designed to hold pallets positioned with an offset of x=15, y=0, z=11. The distance between rows is 419 units and between columns is 76 units. This setup will provide an organized and efficient storage solution for boxes within the pallets.
