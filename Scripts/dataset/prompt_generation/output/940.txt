Create a 3D racks cluster system with 2 rows and 4 columns, featuring racks organized in a grid layout. Each rack consists of 3 rows and 4 columns, with trays to hold pallets. The pallets within each tray have a specific offset of x: 20, y: 0, z: 11 for precise positioning. The distance between rows is 499 units and between columns is 83 units. Start building the cluster structure following these specifications to achieve an organized and efficient layout.
