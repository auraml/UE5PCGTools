Create a 3D racks cluster system with 4 rows and 4 columns of racks. Each rack consists of 3 rows and 3 columns of trays, with pallets positioned with an offset of x: 15, y: 0, z: 11. The distance between rows is 266 units, and between columns is 373 units. Fill the trays with pallets holding boxes for a realistic representation.
