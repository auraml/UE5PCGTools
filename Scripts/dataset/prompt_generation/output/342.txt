Create a 3D racks cluster system with a total of 3 rows and 3 columns. Each rack within the cluster contains 1 row and 4 columns. The distance between rows is 96 units and between columns is 277 units. Within each rack, trays have pallets positioned with an offset of x=19, y=0, z=11. Start building the system based on this configuration.
