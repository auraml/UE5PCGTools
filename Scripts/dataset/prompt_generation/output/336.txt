Construct a 3D racks cluster system with a configuration of 3 rows and 5 columns. The racks within the cluster are arranged with a spacing of 205 units between rows and 10 units between columns. Each rack is designed with 5 rows and 1 column. The trays within the rack have pallets positioned with an offset of 11 units along the x-axis and z-axis, while y-axis is fixed at 0. Start building the cluster system according to this layout specification.
