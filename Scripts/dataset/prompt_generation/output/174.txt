Create a 3D racks cluster system with 3 rows and 5 columns of racks, each rack having 3 rows and 5 columns of trays. The trays in the rack have pallets positioned with an offset of x: 11, y: 0, z: 11. The distance between rows is 133 units and between columns is 485 units. Each pallet on the trays will hold boxes in a unique configuration. Start by visualizing the cluster layout and then proceed to render the detailed racks system accordingly.
