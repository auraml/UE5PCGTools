Create a 3D racks cluster system with 4 rows and 5 columns of racks. Each rack consists of 4 rows and 2 columns of trays. The pallets on the trays have an offset of x: 15, y: 0, z: 11. Ensure that the distance between rows is 231 and between columns is 50. Start building the cluster system according to these specifications.
