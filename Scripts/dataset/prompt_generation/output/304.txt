Create a 3D racks cluster system with 3 rows and 4 columns. Each rack within the cluster contains 3 rows and 3 columns. The distance between rows is 238 units and between columns is 388 units. For each tray in the rack, the pallet is positioned with an offset of x=11, y=0, z=11. The system should be designed to reflect these specifications accurately.
