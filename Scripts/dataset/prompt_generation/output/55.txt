Create a 3D racks system with a cluster configuration consisting of 1 row and 4 columns. The racks in the cluster are organized in 5 rows and 1 column each. The distance between rows is 12 units and between columns is 112 units. The trays within the racks have pallets positioned with an offset of x=10, y=0, z=11 for optimal placement of boxes. Build the system to visualize this arrangement accurately in 3D.
