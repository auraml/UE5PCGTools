Create a 3D racks cluster system with 3 rows and 4 columns of racks. Each rack consists of 3 rows and 4 columns of trays where pallets are positioned. The pallets within the trays have an offset of x: 17, y: 0, z: 11. The distance between rows is 153 units and between columns is 283 units. Start building the cluster by arranging the racks in rows and columns following the given specifications.
