Build a 3D racks system consisting of a cluster with 2 rows and 3 columns of racks. Each rack comprises 5 rows and 4 columns of trays. The pallets on trays have an offset of x: 14, y: 0, z: 11. Ensure the distance between rows is 432 units and between columns is 335 units. Start constructing the cluster system based on these specifications.
