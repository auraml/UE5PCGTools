Create a 3D racks system with a cluster consisting of 4 rows and 3 columns. Each rack in the cluster has 1 row and 4 columns. The trays in each rack are designed to hold pallets, which are positioned with an offset of x=12, y=0, z=11. Be sure to arrange the pallets in a visually appealing layout within the cluster.
