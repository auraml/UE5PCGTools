Create a 3D racks cluster system with 3 rows and 3 columns of racks. Each rack consists of 4 rows and 5 columns of trays. Position the pallets on the trays with an offset of x=16, y=0, z=11. The distance between rows is 186 units and between columns is 395 units. Build this cluster system to represent the storage arrangement accurately.
