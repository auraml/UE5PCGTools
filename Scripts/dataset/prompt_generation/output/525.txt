Create a 3D racks system with a cluster consisting of 4 rows and 3 columns of racks. Each rack has 4 rows and 2 columns of trays. The pallet on each tray has an offset of x: 18, y: 0, z: 11 for positioning. The distance between rows is 174 units and between columns is 139 units. Start by visualizing the cluster layout and then proceed to build the racks with the specified parameters.
