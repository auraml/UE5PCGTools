Create a 3D racks cluster system with 4 rows and 2 columns. Each rack in the cluster consists of 3 rows and 5 columns of trays. Place the pallets on the trays with an offset of x: 18, y: 0, z: 11. Ensure a distance of 86 between rows and 110 between columns in the cluster. Build the system to accurately represent this configuration.
