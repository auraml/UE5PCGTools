Create a 3D racks system with a cluster containing 3 rows and 4 columns of racks. The racks are arranged with a distance of 308 units between rows and 349 units between columns. Each rack consists of 1 row and 4 columns of trays. Position the pallets on the trays with an offset of 16 units along the x-axis, 0 units along the y-axis, and 11 units along the z-axis. Remember to accurately place the boxes on the pallets to complete the system.
