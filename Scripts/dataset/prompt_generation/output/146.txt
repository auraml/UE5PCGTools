Create a 3D racks cluster system with the following specifications:

- Number of cluster rows: 3
- Number of cluster columns: 3
- Row distance: 476 units
- Column distance: 142 units
- Number of rack rows: 4
- Number of rack columns: 1
- Tray pallet offset: 
  - X-axis: 15 units
  - Y-axis: 0 units
  - Z-axis: 11 units

Visualize the racks system with these dimensions and configurations to accurately represent the cluster, racks, trays, pallets, and boxes.
