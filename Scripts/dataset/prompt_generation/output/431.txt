Create a 3D racks cluster system with 4 rows and 3 columns of racks. Each rack consists of 2 rows and 2 columns of trays. The pallets within the trays have an offset of x: 11, y: 0, z: 11. The distance between rows is 225 units and between columns is 18 units. Let's arrange the boxes on the pallets within the trays accurately within this layout.
