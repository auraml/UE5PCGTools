Create a 3D racks cluster system with 3 rows and 2 columns of racks. Each rack consists of 1 row and 5 columns of trays. The trays within the rack have pallets positioned with an offset of x: 20, y: 0, z: 11. The distance between rows is 345 units, and between columns is 173 units. Start by arranging the cluster layout according to these specifications.
