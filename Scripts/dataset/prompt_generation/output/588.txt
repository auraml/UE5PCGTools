Create a 3D racks cluster system with 2 rows and 5 columns of racks. The individual racks are arranged in a 4x4 grid within the cluster. Each tray in the rack is configured with a pallet offset of x: 16, y: 0, z: 11. The distance between rows is 75 units and between columns is 145 units. Start building the cluster with these specifications.
