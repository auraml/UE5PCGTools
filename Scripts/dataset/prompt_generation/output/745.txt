Create a 3D racks cluster system with a Cluster consisting of 3 rows and 1 column. Each Rack within the cluster has 3 rows and 3 columns. The trays in each rack have pallets positioned with an offset of x: 17, y: 0, z: 11. Ensure the distance between rows is 475 units and between columns is 482 units.
