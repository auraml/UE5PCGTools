Create a 3D racks cluster system with 2 rows and 2 columns in the cluster. Each rack has 1 row and 4 columns. The distance between rows is 329 units and between columns is 347 units. The pallet on each tray has an offset of x: 16, y: 0, z: 11 for accurate placement. Start building the cluster by arranging the racks accordingly.
