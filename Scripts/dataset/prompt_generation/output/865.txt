Create a 3D racks system with a cluster setup consisting of 4 rows and 1 column. Each rack within the cluster is organized into 2 rows and 4 columns. The trays in the rack are designed with a pallet offset of x: 16, y: 0, z: 11. The distance between rows is 482 units, and between columns is 306 units. Build the system according to these specifications to visualize the racks layout accurately.
