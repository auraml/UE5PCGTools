Create a 3D racks cluster system with 3 rows and 4 columns of racks. Each rack consists of 3 rows and 4 columns of trays for pallets, with an offset of 15 on the x-axis, 0 on the y-axis, and 11 on the z-axis for pallet positioning. The distance between rows is 387 units and between columns is 52 units.
