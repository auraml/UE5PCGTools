Create a 3D racks cluster system with 4 rows and 3 columns of racks. Each rack consists of 1 row and 3 columns of trays. The distance between rows is 335 units and between columns is 365 units. The pallets on trays have an offset of 20 units on the x-axis, 0 units on the y-axis, and 11 units on the z-axis.
