- Cluster with 2 rows and 1 column, spacing rows by 405 units and columns by 280 units.
- Each rack consists of 4 rows and 1 column.
- Trays within the rack positioned with a pallet offset of x: 13, y: 0, z: 11 units.

Build the racks cluster system based on the provided specifications for an organized and efficient storage solution.
