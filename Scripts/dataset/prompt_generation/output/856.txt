Create a 3D racks system with a cluster consisting of 2 rows and 4 columns. In each rack with 3 rows and 3 columns, position the pallet on trays with an offset of x: 18, y: 0, z: 11 within the cluster setup. Consider the distance between rows at 474 units and columns at 60 units when arranging the racks.
