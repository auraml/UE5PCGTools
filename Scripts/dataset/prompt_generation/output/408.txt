Create a 3D racks cluster system with a cluster containing 2 rows and 3 columns of racks. Each rack consists of 1 row and 4 columns of trays. The pallets within the trays have an offset of x: 20, y: 0, z: 11. The distance between rows is 172 units and between columns is 40 units. Let's build this cluster system in a virtual environment.
