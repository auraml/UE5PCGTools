Create a 3D racks cluster system with 4 rows and 2 columns. Each rack in the cluster consists of 4 rows and 4 columns. The trays within the racks have pallets positioned with an offset of x: 16, y: 0, z: 11. The distance between rows is 311 units and between columns is 497 units. Start building the cluster now.
