Create a 3D racks cluster system with the following configuration: 

- Cluster consisting of 4 rows and 2 columns, with row distance of 338 units and column distance of 254 units.
- Each rack within the cluster has 2 rows and 5 columns.
- Trays within the racks are set up with pallets positioned at an offset of x: 19, y: 0, z: 11 units. 

Start by visualizing the cluster layout, then construct racks with trays and pallets, ensuring the specified offsets are accurately represented in the 3D model.
