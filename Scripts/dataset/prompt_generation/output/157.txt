Create a 3D racks cluster system with 2 rows and 2 columns of racks. Each rack consists of 5 rows and 5 columns of trays, where pallets are positioned with an offset of x: 10, y: 0, z: 11. The distance between rows is 83 units and between columns is 245 units. Now, start building the cluster system based on these specifications.
