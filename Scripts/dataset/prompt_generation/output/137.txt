Create a 3D racks system with a cluster setup consisting of 4 rows and 4 columns. Each rack within the cluster has 3 rows and 1 column. Place trays in the rack where each tray is positioned with an offset of x: 20, y: 0, z: 11. The distance between rows is 367 units and between columns is 206 units. Fill the trays with pallets holding boxes, creating a realistic and organized racks cluster system.
