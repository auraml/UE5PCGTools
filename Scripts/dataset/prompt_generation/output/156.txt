Create a 3D racks cluster system with 2 rows and 4 columns. Each rack within the cluster consists of 4 rows and 4 columns. The distance between rows is 134 units, and between columns is 260 units. Each tray within a rack has pallets positioned with an offset of x: 13, y: 0, z: 11. Start building the system based on these specifications.
