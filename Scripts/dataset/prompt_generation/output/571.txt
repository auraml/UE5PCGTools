Create a 3D racks cluster system with a cluster consisting of 3 rows and 3 columns. Each rack within the cluster has 2 rows and 2 columns, with trays positioned to hold pallets. The pallets have an offset of x: 10, y: 0, z: 11 on the trays. Ensure proper spacing between rows and columns is maintained.
