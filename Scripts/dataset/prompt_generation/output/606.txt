Create a 3D racks cluster system with the following specifications:  

- Cluster setup with 2 rows and 1 column.
- Grid distance between rows is 48 units and 123 units between columns.
- Rack structure includes 3 rows and 1 column.
- Each tray within the rack has a pallet with an offset of x: 18, y: 0, z: 11.  

Build the cluster system accordingly, incorporating these dimensions and configurations for an accurate representation.
