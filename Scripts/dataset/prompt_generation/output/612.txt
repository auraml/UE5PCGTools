Create a 3D racks cluster system with 5 rows and 5 columns of racks. Each rack contains 3 rows and 5 columns of trays. The distance between rows is 176 units and between columns is 442 units. The trays within each rack have pallets positioned with an offset of x: 20, y: 0, z: 11. Let's visualize this rack system in a 3D environment.
