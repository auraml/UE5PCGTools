Create a 3D racks cluster system with 3 rows and 2 columns of racks. Each rack contains 3 rows and 2 columns of trays where pallets are positioned. The pallets have an offset of x=16, y=0, and z=11 within the trays. The distance between rows is 18 units and between columns is 319 units. Start building the cluster now.
