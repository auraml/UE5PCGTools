Create a 3D racks cluster system with a main cluster consisting of 4 rows and 4 columns. Each individual rack within the cluster is configured with 2 rows and 3 columns. The trays in each rack are designated to hold pallets with an offset of x: 14, y: 0, z: 11. The distance between rows is 32 units and between columns is 162 units. Start by visualizing the cluster layout, then proceed to construct racks with trays and pallets according to the specified dimensions and offsets.
