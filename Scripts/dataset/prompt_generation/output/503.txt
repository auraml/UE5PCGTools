Create a 3D racks cluster system with 5 rows and 2 columns of racks. Each rack consists of 4 rows and 5 columns of trays. The distance between rows is 387 units and between columns is 314 units. The pallets on trays have an offset of 11 units along the x-axis and z-axis, with no offset along the y-axis. Start building the cluster now.
