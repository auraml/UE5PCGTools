Create a 3D racks cluster system with 4 rows and 3 columns of racks. Each rack consists of 2 rows and 3 columns of trays arranged in a specific pattern. The pallets on each tray are offset by 12 units along the x-axis and 11 units along the z-axis. The distance between rows is 260 units and between columns is 355 units. Build the cluster system accordingly.
