Create a 3D racks system with a single cluster consisting of 4 racks arranged in 1 row with 4 columns. Each rack comprises 4 rows and 2 columns of trays. The pallets within the trays have an offset of 12 units in the x-direction and 11 units in the z-direction. The spacing between rows is 347 units, and between columns is 105 units. Position the boxes randomly on top of each pallet to complete the setup.
