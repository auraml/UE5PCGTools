Create a 3D racks cluster system with 4 rows and 4 columns of racks. Each rack consists of 2 rows and 3 columns of trays to hold pallets. The pallets within each tray have an offset position of x: 19, y: 0, z: 11. The distance between rows is 217 units and between columns is 411 units. Let's build this unique cluster system in 3D.
