Create a 3D racks system with a cluster configuration of 4 rows and 2 columns. Each rack within the cluster consists of 5 rows and 1 column. The pallet trays are positioned with an offset of x: 17, y: 0, z: 11 within the rack. Ensure a distance of 278 between rows and 324 between columns when arranging the racks in the cluster. Let's visualize and design this racks cluster system.
