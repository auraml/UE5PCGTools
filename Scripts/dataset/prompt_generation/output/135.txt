Build a 3D racks cluster system with multiple racks organized in rows and columns. The cluster consists of 5 rows and 2 columns, spaced 385 units apart horizontally and 24 units apart vertically. Each rack is configured with 1 row and 4 columns. The trays within the rack have pallets positioned with an offset of 19 units along the x-axis, 0 units along the y-axis, and 11 units along the z-axis. Start constructing the cluster system based on these specifications.
