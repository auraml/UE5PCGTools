Create a 3D racks cluster system with 4 rows and 3 columns of racks. Each rack consists of 2 rows and 5 columns, with trays to hold pallets. The pallets are positioned with an offset of x: 14, y: 0, z: 11 within the trays. The distance between rows is 31 units and between columns is 270 units. Start by constructing the cluster layout before adding individual racks, trays, pallets, and boxes to complete the system.
