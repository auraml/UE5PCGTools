Create a 3D racks cluster system with 4 rows and 4 columns in a structured layout. The racks are positioned with a distance of 180 units between rows and 417 units between columns. Each rack consists of 4 columns with trays for pallets. The pallets are placed with an offset of 11 units on the x-axis and z-axis within each tray. Start building the cluster system based on these specifications.
