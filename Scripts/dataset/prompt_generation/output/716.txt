Create a 3D racks cluster system with a cluster composed of 3 rows and 5 columns of racks. Each rack consists of 3 rows and 3 columns of trays. The pallets on trays have an offset position of x: 15, y: 0, z: 11. The distance between rows is 313 units, and between columns is 431 units. Let's visualize this racks cluster system in 3D.
