Create a 3D racks cluster system with a main cluster consisting of 5 rows and 1 column. The racks are arranged in a grid with specific distances between rows (218 units) and columns (67 units). Each rack within the cluster contains 1 row and 4 columns of tray slots. The trays have pallets positioned with an offset of x: 12, y: 0, z: 11 units. Fill the pallets with boxes to complete the system.
