Create a 3D racks system with a cluster configuration of 2 rows and 1 column. Each rack within the cluster consists of 2 rows and 1 column. The distance between rows is 38 units, and the distance between columns is 67 units. The trays within each rack have a pallet positioned with an offset of x: 12, y: 0, z: 11. Start by visualizing this setup to accurately represent the layout of the racks system in 3D.
