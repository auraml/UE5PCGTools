Create a 3D racks cluster system with 2 rows and 4 columns of racks. Each rack consists of 1 row and 4 columns of trays for pallets. The pallets are positioned with an offset of x: 15, y: 0, z: 11 within the trays. The distance between rows is 389 units and between columns is 36 units. Start by organizing the racks accordingly to represent the cluster system.
