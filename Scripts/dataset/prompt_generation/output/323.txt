Create a 3D racks cluster system with multiple rows and columns of racks. The cluster consists of 5 rows and 5 columns, with a specific distance between rows and columns. Each rack is organized into 4 rows and 5 columns, and within each rack, trays are positioned for pallets. The pallets on trays have a unique offset with values for x, y, and z coordinates. Start by arranging the racks accordingly and positioning the pallets on trays with the specified offsets.
