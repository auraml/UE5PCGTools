Create a 3D racks cluster system with 3 rows and 3 columns of clusters. Each cluster consists of 4 rows and 3 columns of racks. The distance between rows is 64 units and between columns is 317 units. Each rack contains trays where pallets are positioned with an offset of x: 18, y: 0, z: 11. Fill the pallets with boxes to complete the visualization.
