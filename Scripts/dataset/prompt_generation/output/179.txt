Create a 3D racks system with a cluster consisting of 2 rows and 5 columns. Each rack within the cluster is structured with 3 rows and 4 columns. The distance between rows is 50 units, and between columns is 363 units. The trays within the racks have pallets positioned with an offset of x: 18, y: 0, z: 11. Each pallet will hold boxes in this setup.
