Create a 3D racks cluster system with 3 rows and 1 column of clusters. Each cluster consists of 3 rows and 3 columns of racks. The distance between rows is 274 units and between columns is 495 units. Each rack has trays where pallets are placed, with a pallet offset of x: 14, y: 0, z: 11. Build the system accordingly to visualize the layout accurately.
