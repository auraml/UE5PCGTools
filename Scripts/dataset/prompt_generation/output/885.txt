Create a 3D racks cluster system with 2 rows and 3 columns of racks. Each rack consists of 2 rows and 3 columns of trays. Each tray has pallets positioned with an offset of x: 11, y: 0, z: 11. Ensure the distance between rows is 79 units and between columns is 358 units. Time to design a structured and efficient cluster system!
