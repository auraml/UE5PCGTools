Build a 3D racks system with a cluster containing 4 rows and 3 columns. The spacing between rows is 221 units and between columns is 364 units. Each rack in the cluster consists of a single row and column. The tray within the rack has a pallet positioned with an offset of 15 units in the x-direction, 0 units in the y-direction, and 11 units in the z-direction.
