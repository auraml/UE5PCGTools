Create a 3D racks cluster system with 5 rows and 5 columns of racks, where each rack consists of 3 rows and 4 columns of trays. The distance between rows is 276 units and between columns is 272 units. Each tray within the rack has a pallet positioned with an offset of x: 16, y: 0, z: 11. Place boxes randomly on the pallets to complete the system.
