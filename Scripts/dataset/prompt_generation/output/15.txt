Create a 3D racks cluster system with the following specifications: 
- Cluster with 1 row and 4 columns, where racks are placed
- Each rack consists of 2 rows and 3 columns for trays
- Trays have pallets with an offset of x: 18, y: 0, z: 11
- The distance between rows is 131 and between columns is 335

Start by constructing the racks cluster based on these dimensions and configurations.
