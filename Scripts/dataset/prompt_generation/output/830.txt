Create a 3D racks system with a single row of 5 racks. Each rack consists of 3 rows and 1 column of trays. The pallets on the trays have an offset of x: 20, y: 0, z: 11. The distance between rows is 478 units and between columns is 362 units. Build the cluster with precision according to these specifications.
