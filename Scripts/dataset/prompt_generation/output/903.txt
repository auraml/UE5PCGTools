Create a 3D racks system with a cluster of 4 rows and 3 columns. Each rack within the cluster consists of 4 rows and 4 columns of trays. Place pallets within the trays with an offset of x: 12, y: 0, z: 11. The distance between rows is 53 units and between columns is 322 units. Start building the system based on these specifications.
