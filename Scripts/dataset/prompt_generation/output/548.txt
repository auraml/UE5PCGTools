Create a 3D racks cluster system with 3 rows and 3 columns of racks. Each rack consists of 5 rows and 4 columns of trays. The distance between rows is 366 units and between columns is 172 units. Each pallet on a tray has an offset of 10 units along the x-axis, 0 units along the y-axis, and 11 units along the z-axis. Place boxes randomly on the pallets within the trays to complete the cluster system.
