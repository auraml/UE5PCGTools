Create a 3D racks cluster system with 4 rows and 1 column of racks. Each rack consists of 4 rows and 2 columns of trays. The pallet within each tray has an offset of x: 19, y: 0, z: 11. The distance between rows is 11 units and between columns is 74 units. Start building the cluster system based on this configuration.
