Create a 3D racks cluster system with 3 rows and 4 columns of racks. Each rack consists of 3 rows and 4 columns of trays. The pallets within the trays have an offset of x: 11, y: 0, z: 11. The distance between rows is 287 units and between columns is 275 units. Position the boxes randomly on the pallets.
