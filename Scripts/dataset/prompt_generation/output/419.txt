Create a 3D racks system with a cluster consisting of 2 rows and 3 columns of racks. Each rack is designed with 4 rows and 5 columns of trays. Pallets within the trays have an offset of x: 19, y: 0, z: 11. The distance between rows is 388 units, and between columns is 53 units. Let's build this intricate racks cluster system in a virtual environment.
