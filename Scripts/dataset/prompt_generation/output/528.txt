Create a 3D racks cluster system with the following configuration:
- Number of rows in the cluster: 2
- Number of columns in the cluster: 3
- Distance between rows: 356 units
- Distance between columns: 117 units
- Each rack in the cluster has:
  - 1 row
  - 3 columns
  - Each tray in the rack has a pallet with an offset of:
    - X: 11 units
    - Y: 0 units
    - Z: 11 units

Build the racks system following these specifications to visualize the layout and arrangement of trays, pallets, and boxes.
