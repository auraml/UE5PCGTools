Create a 3D racks system with a cluster consisting of 2 rows and 1 column. Each rack within the cluster is designed with 3 rows and 3 columns. The trays in the rack have pallets positioned with an offset of x: 12, y: 0, z: 11. Ensure a distance of 357 between rows and 10 between columns in the cluster layout.
