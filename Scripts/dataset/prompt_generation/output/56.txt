Create a 3D racks cluster system with 5 rows and 5 columns of racks. Each rack consists of 2 rows and 4 columns of trays. The pallets within the trays have an offset of x: 15, y: 0, z: 11. The distance between rows is 94 units and between columns is 499 units. Start building the cluster system based on these specifications.
