Create a 3D racks cluster system with a cluster consisting of 3 rows and 1 column. The racks are arranged in a grid with a distance of 456 units between rows and 318 units between columns. Each rack is designed with 5 rows and 1 column of trays. The trays within each rack have pallets positioned with an offset of x: 11, y: 0, z: 11. Let's visualize this cluster system in 3D for efficient storage management.
