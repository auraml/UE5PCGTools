Build a 3D racks system with a cluster containing 4 rows and 4 columns of racks. Each rack consists of 5 rows and 2 columns of trays. The pallets within the trays have an offset of x: 16, y: 0, z: 11. Ensure a distance of 404 between rows and 459 between columns in the cluster setup. Time to create a realistic representation of this cluster system!
