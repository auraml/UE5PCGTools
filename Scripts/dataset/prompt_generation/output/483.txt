Create a 3D racks cluster system with 2 rows and 4 columns of racks. Each rack consists of 2 rows and 4 columns of trays. The trays within each rack are designed to hold pallets with an offset of x=12, y=0, z=11. The distance between rows is 484 and between columns is 44. Start building the cluster system based on these specifications.
