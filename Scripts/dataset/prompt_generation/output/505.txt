Create a 3D racks cluster system with 5 rows and 4 columns of racks. Each rack consists of 3 rows and 3 columns of trays. The distance between rows is 307 units and between columns is 335 units. Position the pallets on trays with an offset of x: 16, y: 0, z: 11. Each pallet will hold randomly arranged boxes. Start building the cluster system based on these specifications.
