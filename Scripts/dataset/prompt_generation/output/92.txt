Create a 3D racks cluster system with 5 rows and 2 columns. Each rack in the cluster has 3 rows and 3 columns. The trays within the racks have pallets positioned with an offset of x=20, y=0, z=11. The distance between rows is 204 and between columns is 278. Time to build a visually appealing cluster system!
