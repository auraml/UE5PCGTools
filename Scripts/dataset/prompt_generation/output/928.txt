Create a 3D racks system with a cluster consisting of 4 rows and 3 columns of racks. Each rack contains 5 rows and 3 columns of trays. The pallets on trays have an offset of x: 13, y: 0, z: 11 for positioning. The distance between rows is 262 and between columns is 205. Start by arranging the racks cluster as specified.
