Create a 3D racks cluster system with 4 rows and 4 columns of racks. Each rack consists of 3 rows and 4 columns of trays. Position the pallets on trays with an offset of x = 10, y = 0, z = 11. The distance between rows is 348 units and columns is 339 units. Populate the trays with pallets holding boxes in a visually appealing arrangement.
