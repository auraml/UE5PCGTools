Create a 3D racks system with a cluster consisting of 5 rows and 3 columns. The racks within the cluster have 4 rows and 1 column each. The trays in the racks are positioned with an offset of x: 15, y: 0, z: 11 for pallet placement. The distance between rows is 65 units and between columns is 68 units. Each pallet will hold boxes arranged on top of them.
