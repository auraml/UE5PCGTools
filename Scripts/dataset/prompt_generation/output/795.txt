Create a 3D racks system with a cluster consisting of 5 rows and 3 columns of racks. Each rack has 5 rows and 2 columns of trays for pallets. The pallets within a tray have an offset of x: 14, y: 0, z: 11 for positioning. The distance between rows is 250 units and between columns is 410 units. Start building the cluster by arranging the racks accordingly.
