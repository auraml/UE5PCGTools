Create a 3D racks cluster system with 3 rows and 4 columns of racks. Each rack consists of 3 rows and 3 columns of trays to hold pallets. The pallets within the trays have an offset position of x: 18, y: 0, z: 11. The distance between rows is 383 units and between columns is 354 units. Start by arranging the racks in rows and columns to build the cluster system efficiently.
