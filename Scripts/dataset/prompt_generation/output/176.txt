Construct a 3D racks cluster system with 3 rows and 4 columns of racks. Each rack consists of 5 rows and 5 columns of trays. The pallets within the trays have an offset of x: 12, y: 0, z: 11. The distance between rows is 97 and between columns is 476. Start building the cluster system based on these specifications.
