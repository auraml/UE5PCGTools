Create a 3D racks cluster system with 3 rows and 3 columns of racks. Each rack consists of 4 rows and 5 columns of trays. The trays within the racks are designed to hold pallets with an offset of x: 15, y: 0, z: 11. The distance between rows is 345 units and between columns is 133 units. Each pallet on a tray will be used to position boxes in the cluster system.
