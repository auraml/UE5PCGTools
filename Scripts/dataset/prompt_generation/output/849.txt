Create a 3D racks system with a cluster setup containing 2 rows and 4 columns. Each rack within the cluster is organized into 2 rows and 3 columns. The trays within the racks have pallets positioned with an offset of 15 along the x-axis, 0 along the y-axis, and 11 along the z-axis. The distance between rows is 431 units and between columns is 81 units. This setup forms a structured and organized storage system for boxes on pallets within the trays. Start creating the 3D model based on these specifications.
