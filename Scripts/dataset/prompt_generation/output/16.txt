Create a 3D racks cluster system with multiple racks arranged in rows and columns. The cluster consists of 4 rows and 2 columns, spaced apart by 387 units in rows and 57 units in columns. Each rack within the cluster has 3 rows and 1 column, with trays positioned to hold pallets. The pallets on trays have an offset of 13 units in the x-direction, 0 units in the y-direction, and 11 units in the z-direction. Build the system according to these specifications.
