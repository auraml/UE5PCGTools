Create a 3D racks cluster system with 1 row and 3 columns of racks. Each rack consists of 4 rows and 4 columns of trays. The distance between rows is 84 units and between columns is 87 units. Position the pallets with an offset of x: 15, y: 0, z: 11 on the trays within the racks. The pallets will hold boxes in this cluster system.
