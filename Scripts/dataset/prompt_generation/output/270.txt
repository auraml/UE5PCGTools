Create a 3D racks cluster system with 3 rows and 4 columns of racks. Each rack consists of 5 rows and 3 columns of trays. The trays within the racks are designed to have pallets positioned with an offset of x=18, y=0, z=11. The distance between rows is 66 units, and between columns is 387 units. Fill the trays with pallets and arrange boxes on top of each pallet for a complete visualization.
