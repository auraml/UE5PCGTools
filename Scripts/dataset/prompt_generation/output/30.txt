Construct a 3D racks cluster system with a single row and column. Each rack within the cluster is designed with 5 rows and 5 columns. The placement of pallets within trays includes an offset of 10 units on the x-axis and 11 units on the z-axis. The spacing between rows is 323 units, and between columns is 108 units. Position the boxes randomly on the pallets to complete the setup.
