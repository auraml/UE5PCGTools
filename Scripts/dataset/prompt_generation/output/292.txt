Create a 3D racks cluster system with 4 rows and 4 columns of racks. Each rack consists of 4 rows and 2 columns of trays. The distance between the rows is 487 units and between the columns is 111 units. Position the pallets on trays with an offset of x: 19, y: 0, z: 11. Each pallet will hold boxes in this cluster.
