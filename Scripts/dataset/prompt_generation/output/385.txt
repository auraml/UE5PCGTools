Create a 3D racks cluster system with 2 rows and 4 columns of racks. Each rack contains 4 rows and 3 columns of trays. The trays have pallets positioned with an offset of x: 11, y: 0, z: 11. The distance between rows is 334 units and between columns is 161 units. Fill the pallets with boxes to complete the system.
