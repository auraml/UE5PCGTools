Create a 3D racks cluster system with 3 rows and 3 columns of racks. Each rack consists of 5 rows and 3 columns of trays. The trays have pallets positioned with an offset of x: 15, y: 0, z: 11. The distance between rows is 253 units and between columns is 388 units. Start constructing the cluster system based on these specifications.
