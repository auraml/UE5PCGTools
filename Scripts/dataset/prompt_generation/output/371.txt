Create a 3D racks cluster system with 3 rows and 3 columns of racks. Each rack consists of 1 row and 5 columns of trays for pallet placement. The pallets on the trays have an offset of x: 16, y: 0, z: 11 within the rack. The distance between rows is 277 units, and between columns is 343 units. Build the cluster system to visually represent this layout accurately.
