Create a 3D racks system with a cluster consisting of 5 rows and 5 columns. Each rack within the cluster is structured with 4 rows and 2 columns. The trays within the rack are designed to hold pallets with an offset of x=18, y=0, z=11 for positioning within the tray. Ensure proper spacing between rows (164 units) and columns (368 units) in the cluster for an organized layout. Let's proceed with constructing the 3D model based on these specifications.
