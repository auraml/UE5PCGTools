Create a 3D racks cluster system with 5 rows and 2 columns. Each rack within the cluster consists of 2 rows and 3 columns. The trays in the rack are designed to hold pallets with a specific offset of 12 units on the x-axis, 0 units on the y-axis, and 11 units on the z-axis. Additionally, there is a specified distance of 138 units between rows and 444 units between columns in the cluster.
