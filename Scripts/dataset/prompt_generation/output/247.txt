Create a 3D racks cluster system with 4 rows and 3 columns of racks. Each rack consists of 3 rows and 4 columns of trays, with pallets positioned at an offset of x: 17, y: 0, z: 11. The distance between rows is 334 units, and between columns is 424 units. Each tray will hold pallets where boxes will be placed. Start designing the cluster system following these specifications.
