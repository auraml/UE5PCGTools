Create a 3D racks cluster system with the following specifications: 
- Cluster with 4 rows and 3 columns, arranged at distances of 486 units horizontally and 353 units vertically.
- Each rack consists of 2 rows and 4 columns.
- Trays in each rack have pallets positioned with an offset of x=13, y=0, z=11 units.

Start by visualizing the cluster layout with rows and columns, then proceed to construct racks with trays to accommodate pallets at the specified offsets.
