Create a 3D racks cluster system with a cluster consisting of 3 rows and 3 columns. The racks inside the cluster are arranged in 5 rows and 3 columns. Each tray within a rack has pallets positioned with an offset of x: 10, y: 0, z: 11. The distance between rows is 395 units and between columns is 187 units. Fill the trays with pallets holding boxes.
