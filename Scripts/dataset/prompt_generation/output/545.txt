Create a 3D racks cluster system with 5 rows and 3 columns of racks. Each rack consists of 5 rows and 1 column of trays. The distance between rows is 22 units and between columns is 369 units. Each tray within a rack has pallets positioned with an offset of x=15, y=0, z=11 units. Start by visualizing the cluster layout with precise dimensions for optimal placement of pallets and trays.
