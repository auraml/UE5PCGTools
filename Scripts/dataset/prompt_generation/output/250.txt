Create a 3D racks cluster system with 4 rows and 5 columns of racks. Each rack consists of 2 rows and 2 columns of trays. The pallets within the trays have an offset of x:10, y:0, z:11. Place boxes randomly on top of each pallet. The distance between rows is 232 units, and between columns is 319 units.
