Create a 3D racks cluster system with one row and two columns. Each rack within the cluster consists of one row and four columns. The trays in the rack are designed to have pallets with an offset of 20 along the x-axis, 0 along the y-axis, and 11 along the z-axis. Start by arranging the racks in rows with a distance of 362 units between them horizontally and 56 units between them vertically.
