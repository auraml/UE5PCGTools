Create a 3D racks cluster system with 3 rows and 3 columns. Each rack within the cluster has 2 rows and 5 columns. The distance between rows is 457 units and between columns is 355 units. Each pallet within a tray has an offset of 16 units in the x-direction, 0 units in the y-direction, and 11 units in the z-direction. Start building the system based on these specifications.
