Create a 3D racks cluster system with multiple rows and columns. The cluster consists of a single row with 5 columns, spaced apart by 105 units in rows and 363 units in columns. Each rack within the cluster is structured with 3 rows and 1 column. The tray in each rack holds pallets positioned with an offset of 14 units along the x-axis, 0 units along the y-axis, and 11 units along the z-axis.
