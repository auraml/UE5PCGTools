Create a 3D racks cluster system with three rows and two columns. Each rack in the cluster consists of five rows and five columns, with trays positioned for pallets at X offset of 12, Y offset of 0, and Z offset of 11. The distance between rows is 196 units and between columns is 98 units. Start by visualizing the cluster layout and then proceed to construct the racks with the specified dimensions and tray configurations.
