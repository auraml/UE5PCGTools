Create a 3D racks cluster system with 4 rows and 3 columns of racks. Each rack consists of 1 row and 1 column. The distance between rows is 252 units and between columns is 74 units. The trays within the racks have pallets positioned with an offset of x: 14, y: 0, z: 11. Each pallet on the trays holds boxes in a structured layout.
