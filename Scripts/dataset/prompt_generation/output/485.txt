Create a 3D racks cluster system with 4 rows and 3 columns of racks. Each rack consists of 4 rows and 5 columns of trays. The distance between rows is 358 units and between columns is 329 units. Position the pallets on the trays with an offset of x=12, y=0, z=11. Each pallet will hold randomly arranged boxes. Start building the 3D model based on this configuration.
