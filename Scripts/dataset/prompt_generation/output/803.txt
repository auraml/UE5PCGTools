Create a 3D racks system with a cluster consisting of 1 row and 2 columns of racks. Each rack has 3 rows and 2 columns of trays. The pallets on trays have an offset position of x: 19, y: 0, z: 11. Ensure the distance between rows is 397 units and between columns is 162 units. Position the pallets accordingly on the trays within the racks.
