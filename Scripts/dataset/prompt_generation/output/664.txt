Create a 3D racks cluster system with 3 rows and 4 columns of racks. Each rack contains 1 row and 5 columns of trays for pallets. The spacing between rows is 272 units and between columns is 99 units. When constructing the pallet trays, ensure they are offset by 13 units in the x-direction and 11 units in the z-direction. This setup will result in a structured and organized cluster of racks for efficient storage.
