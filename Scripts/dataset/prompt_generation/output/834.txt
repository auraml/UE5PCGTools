Create a 3D racks cluster system with 5 rows and 3 columns. The racks within the cluster are arranged in rows and columns with a distance between rows of 384 units and between columns of 145 units. Each rack consists of 5 rows and 5 columns of trays, where each tray has a pallet positioned with an offset of x: 20, y: 0, z: 11. Start by modeling the cluster layout with the specified dimensions and then detail each rack structure accordingly.
