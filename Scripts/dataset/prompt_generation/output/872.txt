Create a 3D racks system with a cluster consisting of 5 rows and 3 columns. Within the cluster, there are racks arranged in 4 rows and 1 column. Each rack contains trays for pallets, positioned with an offset of x=11, y=0, z=11. The distance between rows is 96 units and between columns is 186 units. Pallets on trays hold boxes in this system.
