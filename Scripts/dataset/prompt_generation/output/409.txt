Create a 3D racks cluster system with the following configuration: 
- One row and one column in the cluster.
- The distance between rows is 61 units and between columns is 383 units.
- The rack consists of 5 rows and 4 columns.
- Each tray within the rack has a pallet positioned with an offset of x=20, y=0, z=11 units. Build the system accordingly.
