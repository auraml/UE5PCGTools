Construct a 3D racks cluster system with multiple racks arranged in rows and columns. The cluster consists of 1 row and 4 columns, with a specific distance set between rows and columns. Each rack within the cluster is designed with 2 rows and 2 columns. Inside the rack, trays are positioned with pallets placed at an offset of x: 20, y: 0, z: 11. Let's create this structured and organized racks system!
