Create a 3D racks cluster system with 2 rows and 5 columns of racks. Each rack consists of 3 rows and 1 column, with trays holding pallets positioned with an offset of x: 11, y: 0, z: 11. The distance between rows is 422 and between columns is 440. Start building the cluster system based on this layout.
