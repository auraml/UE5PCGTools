Create a 3D racks cluster system with a cluster consisting of 3 rows and 5 columns of racks. Each rack has 1 row and 3 columns of trays. Place pallets on trays with an offset of x: 20, y: 0, z: 11 within the racks. Ensure a distance of 40 between rows and 194 between columns for an organized layout.
