Create a 3D racks system with a cluster containing 2 rows and 4 columns of racks. Each rack has 1 row and 1 column of trays. The pallets on the trays have an offset of x=13, y=0, z=11. The distance between rows is 392 units and between columns is 474 units. Let's visualize this racks cluster system in 3D.
