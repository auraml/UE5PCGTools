Create a 3D racks cluster system with 2 rows and 3 columns. Each rack within the cluster has 3 rows and 3 columns. The trays in the rack have pallets positioned with an offset of 20 in the x-direction, 0 in the y-direction, and 11 in the z-direction. The distance between rows is 490 units and between columns is 254 units.
