Create a 3D racks cluster system with 3 rows and 1 column. Each rack within the cluster has 1 row and 1 column. The distance between rows is 83 units and between columns is 47 units. The rack contains trays for pallets, with each pallet positioned at an offset of x: 13, y: 0, z: 11 on the tray. Build this cluster system in a visually organized and accurate manner.
