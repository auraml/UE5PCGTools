Create a 3D racks cluster system with rows 3 and columns 4. The racks are laid out with a distance of 247 units between rows and 177 units between columns. Each rack consists of 1 row and 5 columns. Inside each rack, the trays hold pallets with an offset of x: 10, y: 0, z: 11. Start by arranging the racks in rows and columns following the specified distances, then place trays with pallets inside each rack with the given offset values.
