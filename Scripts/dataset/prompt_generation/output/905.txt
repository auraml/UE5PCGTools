Create a 3D racks cluster system with 3 rows and 4 columns of racks. Each rack consists of 2 rows and 2 columns of trays. The pallets within the trays have an offset position of x: 19, y: 0, z: 11. The distance between rows is 84 units and between columns is 236 units. Start by arranging the racks based on the specified configuration.
