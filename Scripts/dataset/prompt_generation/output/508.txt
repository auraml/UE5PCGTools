Create a 3D racks cluster system with 3 rows and 2 columns. Each rack within the cluster consists of 5 rows and 1 column. The trays in the rack have pallets positioned with an offset of x: 19, y: 0, z: 11. The distance between rows is 115 units and between columns is 132 units. Each pallet on the tray will hold boxes. Start by arranging the racks in rows and columns to form the cluster system.
