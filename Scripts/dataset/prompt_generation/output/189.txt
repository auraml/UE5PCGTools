Create a 3D racks system with a cluster organized in 5 rows and 2 columns. The racks within the cluster are structured in a similar layout of 5 rows and 2 columns. Position the pallets on trays within the racks with an offset of x=20, y=0, z=11. The distance between rows is 196 units and between columns is 11 units. Build the system accordingly to represent the cluster setup accurately.
