Create a 3D racks cluster system with 3 rows and 2 columns of racks. Each rack consists of 5 rows and 1 column of trays. The distance between rows is 56 units, and between columns is 242 units. Each tray within the rack has pallets positioned with an offset of x: 18, y: 0, z: 11. Pallets hold boxes that are randomly arranged on top. Start building the cluster system by placing racks accordingly.
