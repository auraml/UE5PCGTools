Create a 3D racks cluster system with 3 rows and 3 columns. Each rack within the cluster consists of 3 rows and 5 columns. Place trays in each rack with pallets offset by x: 17, y: 0, z: 11. The distance between rows is 395 units and between columns is 30 units. Start building the cluster system based on this configuration.
