Create a 3D racks cluster system with the following specifications: 
- Cluster consisting of 4 rows and 2 columns.
- Racks arranged in 5 rows and 4 columns within the cluster.
- Each rack includes trays for pallets with an offset of x: 12, y: 0, z: 11. 
- The distance between rows is 487 units and between columns is 224 units. 

Start by constructing the racks cluster system based on these dimensions and configurations.
