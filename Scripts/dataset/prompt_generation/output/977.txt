Create a 3D racks cluster system with 5 rows and 3 columns. The racks within the cluster are organized into 2 rows and 3 columns. Each tray within a rack has a pallet with an offset of x: 20, y: 0, z: 11. Make sure to position the racks at a distance of 244 units between rows and 277 units between columns. Place boxes randomly on top of each pallet to complete the cluster system.
