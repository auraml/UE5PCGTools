Create a 3D racks cluster system with 2 rows and 3 columns of racks. Each rack consists of 2 rows and 3 columns of trays. Place pallets on trays with an offset of x: 12, y: 0, z: 11. The distance between rows is 240 units and between columns is 311 units. Fill the pallets with boxes for a complete setup.
