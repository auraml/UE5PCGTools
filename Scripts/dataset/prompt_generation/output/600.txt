Create a 3D racks cluster system with a cluster of 3 rows and 3 columns. Each rack within the cluster has 1 row and 5 columns. The distance between rows is 253 units and between columns is 254 units. Place the pallet on trays within the rack, offset by 16 in the X direction, 0 in the Y direction, and 11 in the Z direction. Fill the trays with boxes to complete the setup.
