Create a 3D racks system with a cluster consisting of 3 rows and 3 columns of racks. Each rack contains 5 rows and 1 column of trays where pallets with an offset of x: 20, y: 0, z: 11 are positioned. The distance between rows is 166 units and between columns is 465 units. Each tray holds pallets which can accommodate multiple boxes. Start by building the racks in the specified arrangement to represent the cluster system accurately.
