Create a 3D racks system with a cluster consisting of 2 rows and 2 columns of racks. Each rack is designed with 4 rows and 2 columns of trays to hold pallets. The pallets are positioned with an offset of x=14, y=0, z=11 on the trays. The distance between rows is 111 units and between columns is 419 units. Each pallet will accommodate boxes in a unique layout. Start by visualizing the cluster structure and proceed to construct individual racks with trays and pallets accordingly.
