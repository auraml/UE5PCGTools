Create a 3D racks cluster system with 4 rows and 3 columns of racks. Each rack consists of 1 row and 2 columns of trays. The pallet on each tray is positioned with an offset of x=16, y=0, z=11. The distance between rows is 125 units and between columns is 418 units. Start building the cluster system according to these specifications.
