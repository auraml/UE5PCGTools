Create a 3D racks system with the following specifications: 

- Cluster with 2 rows and 2 columns, each row/column spaced 238/306 units apart.
- Each rack consists of 4 rows and 3 columns.
- Trays within racks have pallets positioned with an offset of x: 15, y: 0, z: 11 units. 

Start by visualizing the cluster layout to accurately arrange racks and trays within the system.
