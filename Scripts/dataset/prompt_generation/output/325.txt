Create a 3D racks cluster system with 4 rows and 2 columns of racks. Each rack contains 2 rows and 5 columns of trays. The trays have pallets positioned with an offset of x: 20, y: 0, z: 11. The distance between rows is 182 units, and between columns is 161 units. Each pallet within the tray will hold boxes. Start building the cluster system based on these specifications.
