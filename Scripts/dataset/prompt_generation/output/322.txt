Create a 3D racks cluster system with 2 rows and 4 columns. Each rack within the cluster consists of 5 rows and 4 columns. The trays in the racks have pallets positioned with an offset of x: 11, y: 0, z: 11. The distance between rows is 249 units and between columns is 112 units. Remember to place boxes randomly on top of each pallet.
