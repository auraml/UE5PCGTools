Create a 3D racks cluster system with 3 rows and 4 columns of racks, where each rack consists of 5 rows and 1 column of trays. Place pallets on the trays with an offset of x=20, y=0, z=11. The distance between rows is 445 units and between columns is 97 units. Build this cluster system to showcase efficient storage organization.
