Create a 3D racks system with a cluster consisting of 2 rows and 2 columns. Each rack in the cluster is configured with 2 rows and 5 columns. The trays in the racks have pallets positioned with an offset of x: 17, y: 0, z: 11. The distance between rows is 240 units and between columns is 269 units. This layout forms a compact and efficient storage solution for the system.
