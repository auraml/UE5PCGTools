Create a 3D racks system with a cluster arrangement of 4 rows and 3 columns. The rack configuration consists of 5 rows and 3 columns, with pallet trays offset by 14 units on the x-axis, 0 units on the y-axis, and 11 units on the z-axis. The distance between rows is 126 units and between columns is 256 units. Build the racks accordingly for a well-organized cluster system.
