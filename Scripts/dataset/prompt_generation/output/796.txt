Create a 3D racks cluster system with 2 rows and 4 columns of racks. Each rack consists of 4 rows and 2 columns of trays. The pallets within the trays have an offset of x=19, y=0, z=11. The distance between rows is 15 units, and between columns is 488 units. Start by visualizing the cluster layout and then construct the racks with the specified tray configurations.
