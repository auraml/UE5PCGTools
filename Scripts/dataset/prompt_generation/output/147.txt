Create a 3D racks cluster system with 3 rows and 2 columns of racks. Each rack within the cluster consists of 5 rows and 5 columns of trays. The distance between rows is 65 units and between columns is 108 units. Set the pallet offset within each tray to x=11, y=0, z=11 for accurate placement. Each pallet will hold boxes on the trays for a realistic representation of the racks system.
