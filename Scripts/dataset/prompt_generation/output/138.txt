Create a 3D racks system with a cluster containing 4 rows and 2 columns of racks. Each rack consists of 2 rows and 5 columns of trays. Place pallets within trays with an offset of x: 16, y: 0, z: 11. The distance between rows is 228 units and between columns is 238 units. Start building the cluster now.
