Create a 3D racks cluster system with 4 rows and 2 columns of racks. Each rack contains 2 rows and 2 columns of trays. The pallets on the trays have an offset of x: 17, y: 0, z: 11. The distance between rows is 44 units and between columns is 499 units. Build this cluster system to visualize the arrangement of pallets and boxes within the trays.
