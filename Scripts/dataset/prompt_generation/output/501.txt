Create a 3D racks cluster system with 3 rows and 1 column of racks. Each rack consists of 4 rows and 3 columns of trays for pallet placement. The trays have pallets positioned with an offset of x=12, y=0, z=11. The distance between rows is 302 units and between columns is 362 units. Build the cluster accordingly.
