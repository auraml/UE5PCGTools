Create a 3D racks cluster system with 5 rows and 2 columns of racks. Each rack consists of 3 rows and 4 columns of trays. The pallets within the trays have an offset of x: 20, y: 0, z: 11. The distance between rows is 113 units and between columns is 223 units. Build the cluster with precision based on these specifications.
