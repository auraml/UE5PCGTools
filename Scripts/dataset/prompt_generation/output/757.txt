Create a 3D racks cluster system with the following specifications:  

- Cluster setup with 4 rows and 1 column, spaced 300 units apart vertically and 485 units apart horizontally.  
- Racks with 1 row and 5 columns, each containing trays for pallets.  
- The pallets are positioned with an offset of x=19, y=0, z=11 within the trays.  

Design the cluster system accordingly, ensuring correct placement and spacing of racks and trays within the cluster setup.
