Create a 3D racks system with a cluster consisting of 3 rows and 4 columns. Each rack within the cluster has 4 rows and 3 columns. The trays in the racks have pallets positioned with an offset of x: 18, y: 0, z: 11. Ensure the distance between rows is 115 units and between columns is 27 units. Place boxes randomly on the pallets within the trays to complete the system.
