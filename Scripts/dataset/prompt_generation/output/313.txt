Create a 3D racks cluster system with 5 rows and 4 columns of racks, where each rack consists of 3 rows and 5 columns of trays. The trays within each rack are designed to hold pallets with an offset of x=14, y=0, z=11. The distance between rows is 152 units and between columns is 450 units. Each pallet will accommodate boxes arranged in a specific manner. Start building the cluster system according to these specifications.
