Create a 3D racks cluster system with 5 rows and 5 columns of racks. Each rack consists of 1 row and 3 columns of trays. The pallets on the trays have an offset position of x=20, y=0, z=11. The distance between rows is 226 units and between columns is 100 units. Start building the cluster by arranging the racks accordingly.
