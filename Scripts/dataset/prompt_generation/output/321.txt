Create a 3D racks cluster system with 5 rows and 3 columns. Each rack consists of 2 rows and 4 columns, separated by distances of 50 units horizontally and 88 units vertically. The trays within each rack have pallets positioned with an offset of x = 12, y = 0, z = 11. Fill the pallets with boxes to complete the system.
