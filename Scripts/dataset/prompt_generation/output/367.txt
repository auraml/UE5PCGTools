Create a 3D racks cluster system with 5 rows and 2 columns of racks. Each rack consists of 4 rows and 5 columns of trays. Position pallets on trays with an offset of x: 11, y: 0, z: 11 within the cluster. The distance between rows is 389 units and between columns is 143 units. Each pallet will hold boxes for storage.
