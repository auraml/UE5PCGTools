Construct a 3D racks cluster system with the following details:

- Cluster configuration:
  - Rows: 1
  - Columns: 5
  - Row distance: 275 units
  - Column distance: 360 units

- Rack setup within the cluster:
  - Rows: 2
  - Columns: 1

- Tray settings within the rack:
  - Pallet offset:
    - X: 17 units
    - Y: 0 units
    - Z: 11 units

Use these specifications to build a detailed 3D representation of the racks system.
