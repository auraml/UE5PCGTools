Create a 3D racks cluster system with 4 rows and 3 columns of racks. Each rack consists of 3 rows and 4 columns of trays. The pallets on the trays have an offset of x: 16, y: 0, z: 11. The distance between rows is 390 and columns is 434. Start by arranging the racks in rows and columns, then position the trays with pallets accordingly.
