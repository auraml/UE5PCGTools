Create a 3D racks system with a cluster consisting of 4 rows and 3 columns. Each rack in the cluster has 2 rows and 3 columns. Place trays within the rack with pallets offset by x: 13, y: 0, z: 11. Each rack should be positioned with a distance of 131 between rows and 70 between columns. Fill the trays with pallets to accommodate boxes.
