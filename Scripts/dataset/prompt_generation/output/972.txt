Build a 3D racks cluster system with 3 rows and 5 columns of racks. Each rack consists of 5 rows and 3 columns of trays. The distance between rows is 74 units and between columns is 296 units. Position the pallets on the trays with an offset of x: 12, y: 0, z: 11. Fill the trays with boxes to complete the setup.
