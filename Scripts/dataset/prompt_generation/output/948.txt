Create a 3D racks cluster system with a cluster consisting of 4 rows and 5 columns of racks. The racks are arranged with a distance of 500 units between rows and 186 units between columns. Each rack is structured with 5 rows and 4 columns of trays. The trays within the rack have pallets positioned with an offset of x=18, y=0, z=11 units. Start by building the cluster layout based on these specifications.
